# Install Skills - Marketplace Bootstrap

**One-time setup skill.** Run this after adding the marketplace to configure your environment and install skills.

## What This Does

1. **Configure session-start hook** - Automatic CLAUDE.md detection when opening repositories
2. **Install marketplace skills** - Interactive selection with automatic dependency resolution
3. **Verify setup** - Confirm everything is working

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Hook Configuration

Check if session-start hook is already configured:

```bash
Read ~/.claude/settings.json
```

If `hooks.session-start` exists and points to a CLAUDE.md checker:
> ✅ Session-start hook already configured

If not configured, offer to set it up:

> **Configure session-start hook?**
>
> This will automatically check for CLAUDE.md when you open a repository,
> prompting you to set up project type if missing.
>
> Would you like to set this up? (Y/n)

Wait for user response.

**If YES:**

1. Create hook script at `~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check CLAUDE.md exists and declares a project type in current repository.
# Output is read by Claude at session start — messages are directives to act on.

# Only run inside a git repository
if ! git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree &>/dev/null; then
  exit 0
fi

if [ ! -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED: No CLAUDE.md found in this repository."
  echo "Prompt the user to choose a project type and create CLAUDE.md for them."
  echo "Choices: skills | java | blog | custom | generic"
  echo "(See docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md for what each type means)"
elif ! grep -q "## Project Type" CLAUDE.md; then
  echo "⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED: CLAUDE.md exists but declares no Project Type."
  echo "Prompt the user to choose a project type and insert it into CLAUDE.md."
  echo "Choices: skills | java | blog | custom | generic"
  echo "(See CLAUDE.md § Project Type for what each type means)"
fi

# Check for HANDOFF.md and prompt to read it (runs when CLAUDE.md exists)
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ] && [ -f "HANDOFF.md" ]; then
  LAST_UPDATED=$(git log -1 --format="%ar" -- HANDOFF.md 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown age")
  echo "📋 HANDOFF.md found (last updated: $LAST_UPDATED)."
  echo "Before starting: ask the user 'Read your session handover? (y/n)' — if yes, read and briefly summarise HANDOFF.md."
  # Check staleness
  COMMIT_TIME=$(git log -1 --format="%ct" -- HANDOFF.md 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$COMMIT_TIME" ]; then
    NOW=$(date +%s)
    DAYS=$(( (NOW - COMMIT_TIME) / 86400 ))
    if [ "$DAYS" -gt 7 ]; then
      echo "⚠️ Handover is $DAYS days old — flag as potentially stale before summarising."
    fi
  fi
fi

# Check for workspace CLAUDE.md session-start instruction
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  if grep -q "## Session Start" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    : # Workspace configured — session-start add-dir will handle project access
  elif grep -q "## Project Type" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "ℹ️  No workspace configured for this project."
    echo "Run /workspace-init to create ~/claude/private/<project>/ and set up the companion workspace."
    echo "(Keeps methodology artifacts out of the project repo)"
  fi
fi

# Check for Work Tracking configuration
if [ -f "CLAUDE.md" ] && grep -q "## Project Type" CLAUDE.md && ! grep -q "## Work Tracking" CLAUDE.md; then
  echo "ℹ️  OPTIONAL: No issue tracking configured for this project."
  echo "Run /issue-workflow to set up GitHub issue tracking and release-based changelog."
  echo "(Enables cross-cutting task detection and commit split suggestions)"
fi
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh
```

3. Use `/update-config` skill to add hook to settings.json:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "session-start": "~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh"
  }
}
```

4. Confirm:
> ✅ Session-start hook configured
> ✅ ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh created
>
> From now on, opening a repository without CLAUDE.md will show a setup reminder.

**If NO:**
> Skipping hook setup. You can run /install-skills again later to set it up.

Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Skill Selection

Fetch marketplace catalog:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

From the fetched JSON, derive options dynamically:

```python
all_skills = [p["name"] for p in marketplace["plugins"]]
total = len(all_skills)
bundles = marketplace.get("bundles", [])
```

Present options — counts and bundle contents come from the fetched data, never hardcoded:

```
📦 Claude Code Skills Marketplace

What would you like to install?

1. Install ALL skills ({total} total)
   - Complete collection

{for i, bundle in enumerate(bundles, 2):}
{i}. Install {bundle["displayName"]} ({len(bundle["skills"])} skills)
   - {bundle["description"]}

{len(bundles)+2}. Pick individual skills
   - Custom selection

{len(bundles)+3}. Skip installation (just hook setup)

Enter choice:
```

Wait for user input.

### Step 3: Dependency Resolution

Based on user selection, resolve dependencies using this algorithm:

**Dependency Resolution (DFS with Cycle Detection):**

```python
def resolve_dependencies(skill_name, marketplace, resolved, visiting):
    if skill_name in resolved:
        return
    if skill_name in visiting:
        print(f"❌ Circular dependency detected: {skill_name}")
        return
    skill = find_skill_in_marketplace(marketplace, skill_name)
    if not skill:
        print(f"⚠️  Skill '{skill_name}' not found in marketplace")
        return
    visiting.add(skill_name)
    plugin_json_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{extract_repo(skill['source'])}/main/{skill['path']}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json"
    try:
        plugin_metadata = fetch_json(plugin_json_url)
        for dep in plugin_metadata.get("dependencies", []):
            dep_name = dep["name"] if isinstance(dep, dict) else dep
            resolve_dependencies(dep_name, marketplace, resolved, visiting)
    except:
        pass
    visiting.remove(skill_name)
    resolved.append(skill_name)
```

**Selecting skills to install** — read from fetched marketplace, never hardcode:

```python
if choice == "all":
    skills_to_install = all_skills                    # all plugins from marketplace
elif 1 <= bundle_index < len(bundles):
    skills_to_install = bundles[bundle_index]["skills"]  # from marketplace bundles
elif choice == "individual":
    skills_to_install = user_selected_skills          # user picks from all_skills list
else:
    return  # skip

resolved = []
for skill in skills_to_install:
    resolve_dependencies(skill, marketplace, resolved, set())
```

### Step 4: Show Installation Plan

Display resolved skills in dependency order:

```
📋 Installation Plan

The following skills will be installed (in dependency order):

  1. code-review-principles
  2. security-audit-principles
  3. git-commit
  4. java-dev
  5. java-code-review
  6. java-security-audit
  7. java-git-commit
  8. maven-dependency-update
  9. quarkus-flow-dev
 10. quarkus-flow-testing
 11. quarkus-observability

Total: 11 skills

Dependencies will be installed automatically.

Proceed with installation? (Y/n):
```

Wait for user confirmation.

**If NO:**
> Installation cancelled. You can run /install-skills again anytime.

**If YES:** Continue to Step 5.

### Step 5: Install Skills

For each skill in resolved order, run:

```bash
/plugin install <skill-name>
```

Show progress:

```
Installing skills...

  ✅ code-review-principles
  ✅ security-audit-principles
  ✅ git-commit
  ✅ java-dev
  ✅ java-code-review
  ✅ java-security-audit
  ✅ java-git-commit
  ✅ maven-dependency-update
  ✅ quarkus-flow-dev
  ✅ quarkus-flow-testing
  ✅ quarkus-observability
```

### Step 5b: Offer document content boundaries

Check whether document boundaries protection is already configured:

```bash
grep -q "document-boundaries" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "configured" || echo "not configured"
```

If already configured → skip silently.

If not configured, ask:

> **Add document content boundaries protection? (YES / n)**
>
> Prevents personal characterisations, social context, and meeting dynamics
> from leaking into technical artifacts (HANDIFF.md, blog entries, CLAUDE.md
> updates, design docs). Adds a global rule to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that
> applies to all sessions.
>
> Type **YES** to add it, type **n** to skip.

If YES:

```bash
# Write the boundaries file
cat > ~/.claude/document-boundaries.md << 'EOF'
# Document Content Boundaries

Written artifacts — HANDOFF.md, blog entries, CLAUDE.md updates, issues,
design docs, analysis documents — capture:

- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Architectural findings, gaps, and tradeoffs
- Strategic direction and priorities
- Code changes and their effects
- What was built, why, and what comes next

They never capture:

- What specific people said in meetings or reviews
- Personal characterisations of colleagues or stakeholders
- Social or organisational dynamics around decisions
- Meeting context, atmosphere, or interpersonal feedback
- Audience descriptions that identify specific individuals

**The principle:** these documents are technical records. They may be read by
anyone, shared externally, or referenced years later. The technical content must
stand independently of who was in the room when it was discussed.
EOF

# Add @include to global CLAUDE.md (create it if absent)
if [ ! -f ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ]; then
  echo "# Global Claude Instructions" > ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
fi
echo "@document-boundaries.md" >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Confirm:
> ✅ Document content boundaries configured — applies to all sessions.

If n → skip silently.

### Step 6: Completion Message

After all skills installed successfully:

```
<!-- EPHEMERAL TASK: install-skills -->
<!-- RETENTION: Not required after user acknowledgment -->

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎉 Claude Code Skills - Installation Complete!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Session-start hook configured
   Location: ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh
   Effect: Prompts for CLAUDE.md setup when opening new repositories

✅ Skills installed: 11
   Location: ~/.claude/skills/
   Status: Available in ALL conversations (current and future)

✅ Dependencies resolved
   All required dependencies installed automatically

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**What happens next:**

Your environment is fully configured. The installed skills are now
available in ALL Claude Code conversations, not just this one.

**Recommended:** Close this conversation now.

The installation details above can be safely discarded. Skills will
remain available when you start your next conversation.

**To verify installation works:**
1. Close this conversation
2. Open a new conversation
3. Try: /java-dev or /git-commit

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

<!-- This installation log can be safely compressed/forgotten -->
<!-- EPHEMERAL TASK END -->
```

## Error Handling

**Hook script creation fails:**
```
⚠️  Failed to create hook script
Error: [error message]

You can manually create ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh later.
Continuing with skill installation...
```

**Skills installation fails:**
```
❌ Failed to install: <skill-name>
Error: [error message]

Installed so far: X skills
Failed: Y skills

You can retry individual skills with:
  /plugin install <skill-name>
```

**Marketplace fetch fails:**
```
❌ Failed to fetch marketplace catalog
Error: [error message]

Check your internet connection and try again:
  /install-skills
```

## Success Criteria

Installation is complete when:

- ✅ Session-start hook created (if user confirmed)
- ✅ Hook added to settings.json (if user confirmed)
- ✅ All selected skills installed successfully
- ✅ All dependencies resolved and installed
- ✅ User shown completion message with next steps

**Not complete until** all criteria met and user shown final message with "close conversation" recommendation.

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Installing without resolving dependencies | Skills fail due to missing deps | Always run dependency resolution first |
| Not checking if hook exists | Overwrites existing setup | Check settings.json before modifying |
| Silent failures | User doesn't know what failed | Show clear error messages with retry instructions |
| Keeping conversation open | Wastes 200+ tokens rest of session | Recommend closing after completion |

## Notes

- This is a **one-time setup skill** - run once per environment
- Hook script is bash (works on macOS/Linux, may need adaptation for Windows)
- Skills are installed via official `/plugin install` command
- All installation output is ephemeral (safe to forget after reading)
- Skill body is ~250 lines but only loaded when explicitly invoked
