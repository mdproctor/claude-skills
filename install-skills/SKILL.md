# Install Skills - Marketplace Bootstrap

**One-time setup skill.** Run this after adding the marketplace to configure your environment and install skills.

## What This Does

1. **Configure session-start hook** - Automatic CLAUDE.md detection when opening repositories
2. **Install marketplace skills** - Interactive selection with automatic dependency resolution
3. **Verify setup** - Confirm everything is working

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Hook Configuration

Check if session-start hook is already configured:

```bash
Read ~/.claude/settings.json
```

If `hooks.session-start` exists and points to a CLAUDE.md checker:
> ✅ Session-start hook already configured

If not configured, offer to set it up:

> **Configure session-start hook?**
>
> This will automatically check for CLAUDE.md when you open a repository,
> prompting you to set up project type if missing.
>
> Would you like to set this up? (Y/n)

Wait for user response.

**If YES:**

1. Create hook script at `~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check CLAUDE.md exists and declares a project type in current repository.
# Output is read by Claude at session start — messages are directives to act on.

# Only run inside a git repository
if ! git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree &>/dev/null; then
  exit 0
fi

if [ ! -f "CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED: No CLAUDE.md found in this repository."
  echo "Prompt the user to choose a project type and create CLAUDE.md for them."
  echo "Choices: skills | java | blog | custom | generic"
  echo "(See docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md for what each type means)"
elif ! grep -q "## Project Type" CLAUDE.md; then
  echo "⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED: CLAUDE.md exists but declares no Project Type."
  echo "Prompt the user to choose a project type and insert it into CLAUDE.md."
  echo "Choices: skills | java | blog | custom | generic"
  echo "(See CLAUDE.md § Project Type for what each type means)"
fi
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh
```

3. Use `/update-config` skill to add hook to settings.json:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "session-start": "~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh"
  }
}
```

4. Confirm:
> ✅ Session-start hook configured
> ✅ ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh created
>
> From now on, opening a repository without CLAUDE.md will show a setup reminder.

**If NO:**
> Skipping hook setup. You can run /install-skills again later to set it up.

Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Skill Selection

Fetch marketplace catalog:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdproctor/claude-skills/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

Parse JSON and show options:

```
📦 Claude Code Skills Marketplace

What would you like to install?

1. Install ALL skills (18 total)
   - Complete collection: Java, Quarkus, generic principles, documentation sync

2. Install Java/Quarkus bundle (11 skills)
   - Backend development: java-dev, quarkus-flow-dev, code-review, security-audit, etc.

3. Install generic foundation (4 skills)
   - Universal principles: code-review, security-audit, dependency-management, observability

4. Pick individual skills
   - Custom selection

5. Skip installation (just hook setup)

Enter choice (1-5):
```

Wait for user input.

### Step 3: Dependency Resolution

Based on user selection, resolve dependencies using this algorithm:

**Dependency Resolution (DFS with Cycle Detection):**

```python
def resolve_dependencies(skill_name, marketplace, resolved, visiting):
    """
    Resolve dependencies recursively with cycle detection.
    
    Args:
        skill_name: Skill to install
        marketplace: Marketplace catalog (JSON)
        resolved: List of skills in install order (output)
        visiting: Set of skills in current recursion path (cycle detection)
    """
    if skill_name in resolved:
        return  # Already resolved
    
    if skill_name in visiting:
        print(f"❌ Circular dependency detected: {skill_name}")
        return  # Skip circular deps
    
    # Find skill in marketplace
    skill = find_skill_in_marketplace(marketplace, skill_name)
    if not skill:
        print(f"⚠️  Skill '{skill_name}' not found in marketplace")
        return
    
    visiting.add(skill_name)
    
    # Fetch skill's plugin.json from GitHub to get dependencies
    plugin_json_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{extract_repo(skill['source'])}/main/{skill['path']}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json"
    
    try:
        plugin_metadata = fetch_json(plugin_json_url)
        for dep in plugin_metadata.get("dependencies", []):
            dep_name = dep["name"] if isinstance(dep, dict) else dep
            resolve_dependencies(dep_name, marketplace, resolved, visiting)
    except:
        # No dependencies or plugin.json missing
        pass
    
    visiting.remove(skill_name)
    resolved.append(skill_name)
```

**For each bundle:**

**Bundle 1 (All skills):**
```python
all_skills = [plugin["name"] for plugin in marketplace["plugins"]]
resolved = []
for skill in all_skills:
    resolve_dependencies(skill, marketplace, resolved, set())
```

**Bundle 2 (Java/Quarkus):**
```python
java_quarkus = [
    "java-dev", "java-code-review", "java-security-audit", "java-git-commit",
    "java-update-design", "maven-dependency-update", "quarkus-flow-dev",
    "quarkus-flow-testing", "quarkus-observability", "update-claude-md", "adr"
]
resolved = []
for skill in java_quarkus:
    resolve_dependencies(skill, marketplace, resolved, set())
```

**Bundle 3 (Generic foundation):**
```python
foundation = [
    "code-review-principles", "security-audit-principles",
    "dependency-management-principles", "observability-principles"
]
resolved = []
for skill in foundation:
    resolve_dependencies(skill, marketplace, resolved, set())
```

**Bundle 4 (Individual):**
Show checklist of all skills, let user select, then resolve dependencies for selected skills.

### Step 4: Show Installation Plan

Display resolved skills in dependency order:

```
📋 Installation Plan

The following skills will be installed (in dependency order):

  1. code-review-principles
  2. security-audit-principles
  3. git-commit
  4. java-dev
  5. java-code-review
  6. java-security-audit
  7. java-git-commit
  8. maven-dependency-update
  9. quarkus-flow-dev
 10. quarkus-flow-testing
 11. quarkus-observability

Total: 11 skills

Dependencies will be installed automatically.

Proceed with installation? (Y/n):
```

Wait for user confirmation.

**If NO:**
> Installation cancelled. You can run /install-skills again anytime.

**If YES:** Continue to Step 5.

### Step 5: Install Skills

For each skill in resolved order, run:

```bash
/plugin install <skill-name>
```

Show progress:

```
Installing skills...

  ✅ code-review-principles
  ✅ security-audit-principles
  ✅ git-commit
  ✅ java-dev
  ✅ java-code-review
  ✅ java-security-audit
  ✅ java-git-commit
  ✅ maven-dependency-update
  ✅ quarkus-flow-dev
  ✅ quarkus-flow-testing
  ✅ quarkus-observability
```

### Step 6: Completion Message

After all skills installed successfully:

```
<!-- EPHEMERAL TASK: install-skills -->
<!-- RETENTION: Not required after user acknowledgment -->

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎉 Claude Code Skills - Installation Complete!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Session-start hook configured
   Location: ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh
   Effect: Prompts for CLAUDE.md setup when opening new repositories

✅ Skills installed: 11
   Location: ~/.claude/skills/.marketplace/
   Status: Available in ALL conversations (current and future)

✅ Dependencies resolved
   All required dependencies installed automatically

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**What happens next:**

Your environment is fully configured. The installed skills are now
available in ALL Claude Code conversations, not just this one.

**Recommended:** Close this conversation now.

The installation details above can be safely discarded. Skills will
remain available when you start your next conversation.

**To verify installation works:**
1. Close this conversation
2. Open a new conversation
3. Try: /java-dev or /git-commit

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

<!-- This installation log can be safely compressed/forgotten -->
<!-- EPHEMERAL TASK END -->
```

## Error Handling

**Hook script creation fails:**
```
⚠️  Failed to create hook script
Error: [error message]

You can manually create ~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh later.
Continuing with skill installation...
```

**Skills installation fails:**
```
❌ Failed to install: <skill-name>
Error: [error message]

Installed so far: X skills
Failed: Y skills

You can retry individual skills with:
  /plugin install <skill-name>
```

**Marketplace fetch fails:**
```
❌ Failed to fetch marketplace catalog
Error: [error message]

Check your internet connection and try again:
  /install-skills
```

## Success Criteria

Installation is complete when:

- ✅ Session-start hook created (if user confirmed)
- ✅ Hook added to settings.json (if user confirmed)
- ✅ All selected skills installed successfully
- ✅ All dependencies resolved and installed
- ✅ User shown completion message with next steps

**Not complete until** all criteria met and user shown final message with "close conversation" recommendation.

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Installing without resolving dependencies | Skills fail due to missing deps | Always run dependency resolution first |
| Not checking if hook exists | Overwrites existing setup | Check settings.json before modifying |
| Silent failures | User doesn't know what failed | Show clear error messages with retry instructions |
| Keeping conversation open | Wastes 200+ tokens rest of session | Recommend closing after completion |

## Notes

- This is a **one-time setup skill** - run once per environment
- Hook script is bash (works on macOS/Linux, may need adaptation for Windows)
- Skills are installed via official `/plugin install` command
- All installation output is ephemeral (safe to forget after reading)
- Skill body is ~250 lines but only loaded when explicitly invoked
