# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⛔ No AI Attribution in Commits — Ever

**NEVER add AI attribution to any commit message unless the user explicitly requests it for that specific commit.**

No `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, no `Generated-by:`, no `AI-assisted:`, no mention of Claude, AI, or tooling in commit messages. This applies to every commit in every project. Commit messages describe WHAT changed and WHY — not who or what wrote them.

---

## Project Identity

**Name:** cc-praxis
**GitHub:** [github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis](https://github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis)
**Marketplace:** `/plugin marketplace add github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis`
**Status:** Approaching v1.0 release. The collection is feature-complete for its initial scope. Active development continues on the main branch.

## Repository Purpose

This is a skill collection for Claude Code, providing specialized guidance for professional software development workflows. Skills are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that Claude Code loads to execute specific development tasks.

## Project Type

**Type:** skills

## Project Type Awareness

**CRITICAL: Skills must handle different project types with appropriate workflows.**

This repository follows the **type: skills** project model. All repositories using these skills declare their type in CLAUDE.md to enable appropriate commit workflows, documentation sync, and validation.

### Project Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **`skills`** | Claude Code skill repositories |
| **`java`** | Java/Maven/Gradle projects |
| **`blog`** | GitHub Pages / Jekyll blogs |
| **`custom`** | Working groups, research, docs with custom sync |
| **`generic`** | Everything else |

This repository is **type: skills**. See 📖 **[docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md)** for full type definitions, routing logic, and when to use each.

The remainder of this document focuses on **type: skills** specific guidance.

## Skill Architecture

### Frontmatter Requirements

Every `SKILL.md` requires YAML frontmatter with exactly two fields:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-with-hyphens
description: >
  Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]
---
```

**Critical: Claude Search Optimization (CSO)**

The `description` field determines when Claude loads the skill. Follow these rules:

- **Start with "Use when..."** to focus on triggering conditions
- **NEVER summarize the skill's workflow** in the description
- Describe the *problem* or *symptoms*, not the solution
- Keep under 500 characters if possible
- Third person only (no "I" or "you")

**Why this matters:** If the description summarizes the workflow, Claude may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content. Descriptions are for *when to use*, skill body is for *how to use*.

❌ Bad: `description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks`

✅ Good: `description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session`

### Naming Conventions

Skills follow a hierarchical naming pattern:

**Generic principles skills** (suffix: `-principles`):
- `code-review-principles` — language-agnostic review checklist
- `security-audit-principles` — universal OWASP Top 10
- `dependency-management-principles` — universal BOM patterns
- `observability-principles` — universal logging/tracing/metrics

**Language-specific skills** (prefix: language name):
- `java-dev` — Java development
- `java-code-review` — extends `code-review-principles` for Java/Quarkus
- `java-security-audit` — extends `security-audit-principles` for Java/Quarkus
- `java-git-commit` — extends `git-commit` for Java repositories

**Tool-specific skills** (prefix: tool name):
- `maven-dependency-update` — extends `dependency-management-principles` for Maven

**Framework-specific skills** (prefix: framework name):
- `quarkus-flow-dev` — Quarkus + quarkus-flow development
- `quarkus-flow-testing` — Quarkus + quarkus-flow testing
- `quarkus-observability` — extends `observability-principles` for Quarkus

**Why this matters:** The naming pattern makes it clear which skills are generic foundations vs. language/tool-specific implementations. When adding support for new languages, create skills like `go-code-review` (extends `code-review-principles`), `gradle-dependency-update` (extends `dependency-management-principles`), etc.

#### Extending to New Languages

When adding a new language, apply these principles consistently:

1. **Canonical names** — `go-dev` not `golang-dev`, `ts-dev` not `javascript-dev`
2. **1-word base suffix** — `*-dev`, `*-code-review`, `*-security-audit` (not `*-development`)
3. **Tool prefix for tools** — `cargo-*`, `npm-*`, `pip-*`, `gomod-*`
4. **Framework prefix for frameworks** — `react-*`, `vue-*`, `django-*`
5. **Consistency over brevity** — match existing patterns

Quick check: `ls -d *-dev *-code-review *-security-audit 2>/dev/null` should show a consistent pattern.

### Skill Chaining

Skills explicitly reference each other to create workflows. The README documents the complete chaining matrix, but when editing skills:

1. **Add cross-references in "Skill Chaining" sections** (capitalized, not "Skill chaining")
2. **Make references bidirectional** when appropriate (e.g., java-security-audit ↔ java-code-review)
3. **Use Prerequisites sections** for layered skills (e.g., quarkus-flow-testing builds on java-dev and quarkus-flow-dev)
4. **Generic principles skills are never invoked directly** — they're referenced via Prerequisites by language/framework-specific skills

Example chaining patterns:
```
# Java repositories with both DESIGN.md and CLAUDE.md:
java-dev → java-code-review → java-git-commit → java-update-design + update-claude-md (automatic)

# Any repository with CLAUDE.md:
git-commit → update-claude-md (automatic)
```

### Supporting Files

When skill content exceeds ~200 words or includes heavy reference material:

- Extract to separate `.md` files (e.g., `funcDSL-reference.md`)
- Reference from main `SKILL.md`
- Keep skill body focused on workflow and principles

Pattern:
```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md              # Main workflow (required)
  reference-name.md     # Heavy API/reference docs
```

### Skills-Repository-Specific Documentation

**This repository has modularized documentation for skills-specific workflows to avoid token waste in other projects.**

Skills-repository-specific logic (SKILL.md validation, README synchronization) is NOT implemented as portable skills. Instead, it lives in standalone documentation files at the repository root:

| File | Purpose | Used By |
|------|---------|---------|
| **skill-validation.md** | SKILL.md validation workflow (frontmatter, CSO, flowcharts, cross-references) | `git-commit` when type: skills AND SKILL.md files staged |
| **readme-sync.md** | README.md synchronization workflow (skill collection changes) | `git-commit` when type: skills AND skill changes detected |

**Why modularized (not skills):**
- These workflows only apply to THIS repository
- Loading them as skills wastes tokens in all other projects (java, custom, generic)
- They contain heavy reference material (checklists, tables, patterns)
- CLAUDE.md loads automatically in every conversation
- git-commit can reference these files when operating in type: skills mode

**When git-commit operates in type: skills mode:**
1. Check for staged SKILL.md files → Follow skill-validation.md workflow
2. Check for skill collection changes → Follow readme-sync.md workflow
3. Both workflows maintain the same confirmation pattern (propose → user YES → apply)

**These files are NOT:**
- Loaded in java/custom/generic projects (zero token cost)
- Duplicated in skills collection (single source of truth)
- Skills themselves (not in skills/ directory, not user-invocable via Skill tool)

### Flowcharts

Skills use Mermaid `flowchart TD` notation for decision flows. Add flowcharts when:

- Decision points are non-obvious
- Process has loops where you might stop too early
- "When to use A vs B" decisions exist

Never use flowcharts for:
- Reference material (use tables)
- Code examples (use markdown blocks)
- Linear instructions (use numbered lists)

Flowcharts must have semantic labels, not generic ones like `step1`, `helper2`.

### Success Criteria

Skills that produce artifacts (commits, ADRs, dependency updates) include explicit "Success Criteria" sections with checkboxes. This prevents premature completion claims.

Example pattern:
```markdown
## Success Criteria

Dependency update is complete when:

- ✅ User has confirmed changes with **YES**
- ✅ BOM alignment verified (no version drift)
- ✅ Compilation succeeds (`mvn compile` passes)
- ✅ pom.xml changes committed

**Not complete until** all criteria met and changes committed.
```

## Modular Documentation

**Note:** This repository does not use modular documentation. Skills use single `SKILL.md` files.

For projects that split large documents into linked modules (e.g., `DESIGN.md` → `docs/design/architecture.md` + `api.md` + `data-model.md`), with automatic discovery, validation, and sync across all modules:

**See:** 📖 **[QUALITY.md § Modular Documentation Quality Assurance](QUALITY.md#modular-documentation-quality-assurance)** and **[README.md § Modular Documentation](README.md#modular-documentation)**

## Consistency Patterns

When editing skills, maintain these conventions:

### Section Naming

- "Skill Chaining" (capitalized C)
- "Prerequisites" (for layered skills)
- "Success Criteria" (for artifact-producing skills)
- "Common Pitfalls" (table format: Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix)

### Cross-Reference Format

```markdown
## Prerequisites

**This skill builds on `skill-name`**. Apply all rules from:
- **skill-name**: [specific rules that apply]
```

or

```markdown
## Skill Chaining

**Triggered by skill-name:**
When [condition], it should invoke this skill for [reason].

**Chains to skill-name:**
After [milestone], invoke skill-name for [purpose].
```

### Common Mistakes Tables

All major skills include "Common Pitfalls" tables documenting real mistakes:

```markdown
| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| [Anti-pattern] | [Consequence] | [Correct approach] |
```

### Third-Party Skill Exclusion

**CRITICAL: Only document skills authored by the repository owner.**

**Rules:**
- ✅ **Document only user-authored skills** in README.md and CLAUDE.md
- ❌ **Never document third-party skills** (skills from superpowers:*, external repos, etc.)
- ✅ **Add third-party skills to .gitignore** immediately upon discovery
- ❌ **Never reference third-party skills** in documentation (chaining tables, workflows, repository structure)

**Rationale:**
- Third-party skills are maintained elsewhere and can change without notice
- Documenting them creates maintenance burden and stale references
- Users already see third-party skills in their skill list
- README/CLAUDE.md should reflect only what this repository provides

**Implementation:**
1. Add skill directory to .gitignore with comment: `# Third-party skill from [source]`
2. Remove all references from README.md (Skills section, Chaining table, Repository Structure)
3. Remove all references from CLAUDE.md (Key Skills section)
4. Verify removal with: `grep -r "skill-name" README.md CLAUDE.md`

**Examples of third-party skills to exclude:**
- `superpowers:*` (all superpowers skills)
- `skill-creator` (external skill authoring tool)
- `frontend-design:*` (third-party frontend skills)
- Any skill not in version control for this repository

**Quality check:** During deep analysis, verify no third-party skills are documented anywhere. *This is part of the `consistency` category in `project-health`.*

## Developer Workflow

When working on this repository, use these commands:

```bash
# Sync all skills to ~/.claude/skills/ (do this after any skill change)
python3 scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y

# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run commit-tier validators
python3 scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit

# Generate missing slash command files after adding a new skill
python3 scripts/generate_commands.py

# Validate a specific document
python3 scripts/validate_document.py README.md

# Check project type list consistency
python3 scripts/validation/validate_project_types.py --verbose

# Check if a primary doc needs modularising
python3 scripts/validation/validate_doc_structure.py CLAUDE.md

# Validate a blog commit message
python3 scripts/validation/validate_blog_commit.py <<< "post(java): add MCP guide"
```

**After editing any skill:** run `sync-local` so `~/.claude/skills/` has the latest version.
**After adding a new skill:** run `generate_commands.py` AND add to `marketplace.json` plugins list.

## How Claude Code Loads Skills

Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` and are **auto-discovered** — no registration in `settings.json` or `installed_plugins.json` is needed.

**Skills must be real directories, not symlinks.** Claude Code does not follow symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/`. A symlink at `~/.claude/skills/java-dev` pointing elsewhere will be silently ignored — the skill will not load. Always copy skill content into the directory.

**Skills need a `commands/` directory for slash commands.** A skill with only a `SKILL.md` is loadable by Claude via the Skill tool (triggered automatically by description matching) but does NOT create a `/skill-name` slash command in the UI. To register a slash command, the skill must have `commands/<skill-name>.md`. Use `python scripts/generate_commands.py` to create missing command files.

**`~/.claude/plugins/cache/` is the wrong location.** That directory is managed by Claude Code's marketplace package manager (`/plugin install`). Skills placed there work but require versioned subdirectories, `installed_plugins.json` registration, and `enabledPlugins` entries — unnecessary complexity. Always use `~/.claude/skills/` instead.

## Editing Skills

When modifying existing skills:

1. **Check README first** — the Skill Chaining Reference table shows the complete dependency graph
2. **Update cross-references** — if you add chaining, update both skills (source and target)
3. **Preserve CSO descriptions** — don't add workflow summaries to frontmatter
4. **Test flowcharts** — invalid dot syntax breaks skill loading
5. **Maintain Prerequisites** — layered skills (quarkus-flow-*) must reference their foundations

## Pre-Commit Checklist for Skills

**CRITICAL: All items are MANDATORY by default unless explicitly marked (advisory).**

**This is NOT a judgment call. This is NOT optional. This is a DISCIPLINE.**

Failing to execute these checks before committing is a failure, not a decision. The bigger the change, the more critical the checklist becomes. Infrastructure changes especially require documentation sync.

### Mandatory Checks

Run these checks **before every commit** to this repository. *These map to `project-health` categories — see [docs/project-health.md](docs/project-health.md). For a full pre-release health check: `/project-health --all`.*

- [ ] **Commit message** → No `Co-Authored-By`, `Generated-by`, or AI attribution of any kind. Commit messages describe WHAT and WHY only.
- [ ] **New skill added?** → Run `python scripts/generate_commands.py` to create its slash command file `[coverage]`
- [ ] **SKILL.md files modified?** → Follow readme-sync.md workflow (NEVER skip, let it decide if README needs updates) `[docs-sync]`
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md modified?** → Follow relevant update workflow if applicable `[docs-sync]`
- [ ] **New validation/testing added?** → Update README.md § Skill Quality & Validation AND QUALITY.md § Implementation Status `[infrastructure]`
- [ ] **New scripts/ files added?** → Update README.md § Repository Structure `[coverage]`
- [ ] **New chaining relationships?** → Update README.md § Skill Chaining Reference `[cross-refs]`
- [ ] **New features added to skills?** → Update README.md § Key Features `[docs-sync]`
- [ ] **Framework changes** (same pattern across multiple skills)? → Document in README.md AND QUALITY.md if validation-related `[consistency]`
- [ ] **Infrastructure changes** (validators, test infrastructure, orchestrators)? → Update README.md § Repository Structure, QUALITY.md § Implementation Status, and this file § Validation Script Roadmap `[infrastructure]`

### When Work Tracking Is Configured

If a project's CLAUDE.md contains `## Work Tracking` with `Issue tracking: enabled`, Claude must:
- **Before any significant task**: check if the request spans multiple concerns; if so, help break it into separate GitHub issues before starting work
- **Before any commit**: check if staged changes span multiple issues; if so, suggest splitting with `git add -p`
- **In every commit message**: include `Refs #N` or `Closes #N` for the related issue
- **For changelogs**: use `gh release create --generate-notes` — do NOT maintain a CHANGELOG.md manually

The `issue-workflow` skill handles setup of this configuration and the pre-commit analysis.

### When Adding a Skill to a Bundle (or Changing Bundles)

Bundle membership is defined in **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` § `bundles`** — the single source of truth. The install/uninstall wizard skills read this at runtime, so the menus and counts update automatically.

**To add a skill to an existing bundle:**
1. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — add the skill name to the relevant `bundles[].skills` array
2. Commit and push — the wizard picks it up immediately

**To create a new bundle:**
1. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — add a new entry to the `bundles` array with `name`, `displayName`, `description`, and `skills`
2. No changes needed to `install-skills/SKILL.md` or `uninstall-skills/SKILL.md` — they render bundles dynamically

**To remove a skill from a bundle:**
1. Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — remove the skill name from the bundle's `skills` array

**Never** add bundle membership or skill counts directly to `install-skills/SKILL.md` or `uninstall-skills/SKILL.md` — they will drift.

### When Adding a New Project Type

**Adding a new project type (e.g. `python`, `go`) requires updating ALL of these:**

- [ ] **`CLAUDE.md` § Project Types table** — add the new type row (this is the canonical source of truth)
- [ ] **`docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md`** — full type documentation and routing logic
- [ ] **`git-commit/SKILL.md`** — routing logic in Step 0 (adds new type branch)
- [ ] **`install-skills/SKILL.md`** — hook script it creates (`Choices:` line)
- [ ] **`~/.claude/hooks/check_project_setup.sh`** — live hook (`Choices:` line)
- [ ] **Run `python scripts/validation/validate_project_types.py --verbose`** — confirms no hardcoded lists were missed

**The validator (`validate_project_types.py`) catches hardcoded lists automatically at commit time,
but this checklist ensures the new type is fully wired into all workflows.**

### Known Regressions (Learn From These)

**Regression 1:** Validation framework added to 4 sync workflows but README.md not updated. Root cause: Skipped readme-sync.md workflow, rationalized "just internal changes". Result: Documentation drift. Fix: Never skip workflows when SKILL.md files change.

**Regression 2:** Created 14 validators + test infrastructure (17 new files, ~2,800 LOC), committed completion document, but didn't update README.md § Repository Structure or QUALITY.md § Implementation Status until user asked. Root cause: Tunnel vision on Options A/B/C, didn't check Pre-Commit Checklist, rationalized "completion doc is sufficient". Result: Primary documentation out of date. Fix: Infrastructure changes require MORE documentation sync, not less. Checklist is mandatory, not advisory.

---

## Meta-Rule: Checklists Are Mandatory

All checklists in this file and in skills are **MANDATORY** unless explicitly marked `(advisory)`, `Optional:`, or `Consider:`. If not marked, do it.

If a checklist item seems inapplicable: re-read it, check for rationalization, execute it anyway if uncertain. If it truly doesn't apply, document why in the commit message. Never skip silently.

---

## Meta-Rule: Consider Universality First

**CRITICAL: Before applying any fix, ask "Should this be universal?"**

**The principle:**
When you identify a problem and prepare a solution, STOP and consider:
1. **Is this problem specific to one context** (skills repo only, Java only, this file only)?
2. **Or is this a universal problem** (could happen in any project type, any AI assistant, any workflow)?

**If uncertain whether to make it universal → ASK THE USER.**

**Examples:**

| Situation | Narrow Fix | Universal Fix | Correct Choice |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| README.md sync missing | Add check to readme-sync.md only | Add framework change detection to ALL sync workflows | Universal (ADR-0001) |
| Java-specific BOM issue | Fix in maven-dependency-update | Make dependency management universal | Narrow (Java-specific) |
| Rationalization bypass | Strengthen git-commit Step 2b | Add mandatory checks to all workflows | Universal |
| Quarkus event loop bug | Fix in quarkus-flow-dev | Make concurrency universal | Already universal (code-review-principles) |

**Why this matters:**
- **Prevents repeated regressions** - fix once, applies everywhere
- **Scales to future project types** - type: python, type: rust get the fix automatically
- **Reduces user burden** - don't re-discover same problem per project
- **Forces better design** - universal solutions are often cleaner

**When to stay narrow:**
- Domain-specific knowledge (Java annotations, Quarkus configuration)
- Language syntax (Java vs Python vs Go)
- Tool-specific features (Maven BOM vs npm package.json)
- Framework patterns (Quarkus vs Spring)

**When to go universal:**
- Process failures (rationalization, skipping workflows)
- Quality gates (validation, testing, documentation)
- Human behavior patterns (cognitive biases, shortcuts)
- Infrastructure (scripts, automation, validation)

**The test:** If the problem could plausibly occur in a different project type with different technologies, it's probably universal.

**See:** ADR-0001: Documentation Completeness Must Be Universal, Not Project-Specific

## Key Skills

**Generic foundation skills** (not invoked directly, referenced via Prerequisites):
- `code-review-principles` — universal code review checklist (extended by `java-code-review`)
- `security-audit-principles` — universal OWASP Top 10 (extended by `java-security-audit`)
- `dependency-management-principles` — universal BOM patterns (extended by `maven-dependency-update`)
- `observability-principles` — universal logging/tracing/metrics (extended by `quarkus-observability`)

**Language/framework foundation skills** (others build on these):
- `java-dev` — all Java development extends this

**Workflow integrators** (chain multiple skills):
- `git-commit` — entry point for all commits; routes by project type; offers issue-workflow setup on first use
- `java-git-commit` — Java commits with DESIGN.md sync via `java-update-design`. type: java only
- `blog-git-commit` — blog commits with content-type conventions (post/edit/draft/asset/config) and filename validation. type: blog only
- `custom-git-commit` — user-configured commits with primary doc sync. type: custom only
- `java-code-review` — triggers `java-security-audit` for security-critical code
- `issue-workflow` — GitHub issue tracking: setup, cross-cutting task detection, pre-commit split suggestions, and release management via `gh release create --generate-notes`. Invoked by git-commit and by Claude automatically when Work Tracking is in CLAUDE.md
- `skill-validation.md` workflow — blocks `git-commit` if CRITICAL findings exist (not a portable skill; lives at repo root)

**Specialized skills** (domain-specific):
- `quarkus-flow-dev` — builds on `java-dev`, extended by `quarkus-flow-testing`
- `java-security-audit` — OWASP Top 10 for Java/Quarkus, triggered by `java-code-review`
- `maven-dependency-update` — Maven BOM management, builds on `dependency-management-principles`
- `quarkus-observability` — Quarkus observability config, builds on `observability-principles`
- `update-primary-doc` — generic table-driven primary doc sync, invoked by `custom-git-commit`
- `java-update-design` — DESIGN.md sync, invoked by `java-git-commit`
- `update-claude-md` — CLAUDE.md sync, invoked by all commit skills
- `readme-sync.md` — README.md sync, invoked by `git-commit` for type: skills only
- `adr` — Architecture Decision Records in MADR format

**TypeScript/Node.js skills:**
- `ts-dev` — TypeScript development; strict mode, async patterns, error handling, testing
- `ts-code-review` — extends `code-review-principles` for TypeScript/Node.js
- `ts-security-audit` — OWASP Top 10 for TypeScript/Node.js, triggered by `ts-code-review`
- `npm-dependency-update` — npm/yarn/pnpm dependency management, builds on `dependency-management-principles`
- `ts-project-health` — extends project-health for TypeScript projects

**Health & quality skills** (correctness and improvement):
- `project-health` — universal health check; answers "is the project correct, complete, and consistent?"; auto-chains to type-specific skill at tier 3+
- `project-refine` — companion to project-health for improvement opportunities; never blocks work
- `skills-project-health` — extends project-health for type: skills (skill craft, cross-refs, marketplace, validators)
- `java-project-health` — extends project-health for type: java
- `blog-project-health` — extends project-health for type: blog
- `custom-project-health` — extends project-health for type: custom

## Quality Assurance Framework

**Comprehensive validation ensures skills maintain structural integrity, logical soundness, and documentation accuracy.**

Skills are infrastructure code guiding AI behavior across millions of invocations. Quality issues compound exponentially. This framework provides automated checks (scripts), semantic analysis (Claude), and functional testing.

### Quality Assurance Philosophy

**Scripts handle mechanical checks (syntax, structure, format).**
**Claude handles semantic analysis (logic, contradictions, completeness).**

For complete details on the division of labor, validation tiers, what gets checked, and integration patterns:
📖 **[QUALITY.md § The Architecture: Scripts + Claude](QUALITY.md#the-architecture-scripts--claude)**

### Automated Validation

**17 validators across 3 tiers (COMMIT/PUSH/CI):**

For complete validator specifications, tier assignments, and implementation details:
📖 **[QUALITY.md § Implementation Status](QUALITY.md#implementation-status)**

**Pre-Commit Checklist integration:** See § Pre-Commit Checklist for Skills below for mandatory validation hooks.

### Deep Analysis Procedures

When user requests deep analysis of skills ("/skill-review", "do a deep analysis", "comprehensive review"):

*These checks map to the `project-health` skill. Invoke as `/project-health --deep` for a full deep analysis, or with specific categories.*

📖 **[QUALITY.md § Deep Analysis Validation](QUALITY.md#deep-analysis-validation-level-2)**

**Mandatory checklist:**
- [ ] Run all automated checks (`python scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit`)
- [ ] Perform all manual analysis procedures (reference accuracy, logical soundness, completeness, etc.)
- [ ] Document findings by severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/NOTE)
- [ ] Create action items for CRITICAL/WARNING findings

### Validation Infrastructure

For complete inventory of validation scripts by tier:
📖 **[QUALITY.md § Validation Script Roadmap](QUALITY.md#validation-script-roadmap)**

**Quick reference (17 validators total):**
- **COMMIT tier (<2s)**: frontmatter, CSO, references, naming, sections, structure, project-types, flowcharts, doc-structure, blog-commit
- **PUSH tier (<30s)**: cross-document, temporal, usability, edge cases, behavior, readme-sync
- **CI tier (<5min)**: Python quality (mypy, flake8, bandit) + functional tests

### Success Criteria

Validation framework is working when:
- ✅ Zero CRITICAL findings pass pre-commit
- ✅ All skills have functional tests
- ✅ All known issues have regression tests
- ✅ Deep analysis finds ≤5 WARNING issues per 40 skills
- ✅ No duplicate issues across releases
- ✅ CI blocks PRs with validation failures

For complete success criteria and implementation status:
📖 **[QUALITY.md § Success Criteria for QA Framework](QUALITY.md#success-criteria-for-qa-framework)**

---

## Document Sync Quality Assurance

**Universal validation prevents document corruption during sync operations across all project types.**

For complete details on validation rules, integration points, corruption patterns, and regression prevention:
📖 **[QUALITY.md § Document Sync Quality Assurance](QUALITY.md#document-sync-quality-assurance)**

### Running Validators Locally

```bash
# Validate a specific document
python scripts/validate_document.py README.md
python scripts/validate_document.py CLAUDE.md

# Validate all staged .md files
git diff --staged --name-only | grep '\.md$' | xargs -I{} python scripts/validate_document.py {}

# Run full commit-tier validation suite
python scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit
```

Exit codes: `0` = clean · `1` = CRITICAL (blocks commit) · `2` = WARNING (review recommended) · `3` = NOTE

Local validation is optional but recommended — pre-commit validation runs automatically and is mandatory.
