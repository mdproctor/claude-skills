# Retro Issues

Maps a repository's git history to a structured set of GitHub issues and, where
naturally warranted, epics.

**Priority order — most important first:**

1. **Group similar commits into the right tickets.** This is the primary goal.
   Commits that belong together should land in one issue, not several.
2. **Produce useful standalone issues** grouped by feature area.
3. **Form epics only when structure emerges naturally** — never force an epic
   to contain unrelated work just because the commits happened at the same time.

If the only output is standalone issues, that is a perfectly correct result.

**This skill is invoked only explicitly.** It is never auto-triggered by
Work Tracking or any other automatic behaviour. Use `issue-workflow` for
ongoing lifecycle enforcement.

## Safety contract

All git operations are read-only until the user confirms with YES.
Git history is never modified by the main flow.
The optional commit-amendment step (Step 10) is separate, gated, and
requires explicit team coordination acknowledgement before proceeding.

---

## Step 1 — Check prerequisites

```bash
git remote get-url origin   # needs a GitHub remote
gh auth status              # needs gh CLI authenticated
```

Extract `owner/repo`. If either fails, stop and tell the user.

Check for a very large history and offer to scope it:
```bash
git rev-list --count HEAD
```

If > 500 commits:
> This repo has {N} commits. Analysing all of them may produce too many
> groupings to review comfortably.
>
> Scope options:
> - **Date range** — e.g. "from 2024-01-01"
> - **Last N commits** — e.g. "last 200 commits"
> - **All** — proceed with full history

Wait for user choice before continuing.

Check for existing closed issues to avoid duplication:
```bash
gh issue list --state closed --limit 10 --repo {owner/repo}
```

If closed issues exist, warn:
> This repo already has {N} closed issues. The retrospective will propose new
> issues alongside them — review carefully to avoid duplicates.

---

## Step 2 — Gather inputs

**Git history:**
```bash
git log --no-merges \
  --format="%H|%ad|%s" \
  --date=short
```

For each commit hash, get changed files:
```bash
git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only {hash}
```

**Tags (phase boundary signals):**
```bash
git tag -l --sort=version:refname
```

**Documents (read each that exists):**
```bash
ls docs/adr/ 2>/dev/null
ls docs/diary/ blog/ 2>/dev/null
cat DESIGN.md 2>/dev/null
```

For each ADR: extract its date and title.
For each blog/diary entry: extract date and any milestone language
("complete", "shipped", "done", "phase", "v1").

---

## Step 3 — Identify phase boundaries

Build a timeline from commit dates. Mark boundary candidates:

| Signal | How to detect |
|--------|--------------|
| ADR created | ADR file date within ±3 days of commits |
| Blog milestone | Blog entry date + milestone language near commit cluster |
| Git tag | Tag date |
| Commit gap | >7 days with no commits between clusters |

Group commits into time windows between boundaries. Each window is a candidate
epic. Name it from the dominant document context (ADR title, blog phase name)
or from the most-changed directory within it.

If no boundaries are found: skip the epic layer entirely — create issues and
standalones only.

---

## Step 4 — Classify commits

The default is **functional** — every commit gets a ticket unless it meets the
narrow trivial definition below. The Excluded Commits table should be small.
When in doubt, include the commit in a ticket.

**Trivial (no ticket — excluded table only):**
- Pure typo fix ("fix typo", "spelling")
- Pure whitespace / formatting ("fix whitespace", "fix formatting", "convert to Mermaid format")
- Merge commits
- That's it. If the commit does anything else — adds code, changes logic, updates
  docs with substance — it belongs in a ticket.

**Dependency bump (standalone ticket — always gets a ticket):**
- Message contains: "bump" or "upgrade"
- Gets its own standalone ticket even if it's a one-line change

**Functional (cluster into issues — the vast majority):**
- Everything that isn't trivial or a bump
- Includes: refactors, renames, doc updates with content, config changes,
  test additions, CI changes, chore commits with real work

---

## Step 5 — Cluster functional commits into issues

Within each time window, group functional commits using this priority order:

**Primary: conventional commit scope**

Extract the scope from the commit subject using the pattern `type(scope): description`.
Commits sharing the same scope form a cluster regardless of which files they touch.

```
feat(garden): add knowledge garden skill  → scope: garden
fix(garden): fix garden indexing           → scope: garden
docs(garden): add examples                 → scope: garden
feat(marketplace): add plugin install      → scope: marketplace
```

This is a much stronger signal than file paths for repos using conventional commits —
it reflects the author's own intent about what feature the commit belongs to.

**Fallback: top-level directory**

If no scope is present in a commit, group it by the top-level directory of its
changed files. This applies to older commits or repos that don't use conventional
commits.

**Merge related scope clusters (most important step):**

Before finalising individual issues, look for scopes that represent facets of
the same feature area and collapse them into one issue:

| Pattern | Example | Collapse to |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Common prefix | `java-dev`, `java-code-review`, `java-git-commit` | "Add Java development skills" |
| Same feature, split by layer | `marketplace`, `install-skills`, `uninstall-skills` | "Build marketplace and installation" |
| Same tool, split by concern | `validation`, `validate-cso`, `validate-docs` | "Add skill validation framework" |

The test: could these issues be reviewed and reverted together without leaving
the repo in a broken state? If yes — they belong in one issue.

Do NOT merge scopes that are genuinely independent features that happen to share
a time window (`garden` and `marketplace` are separate even if committed on the
same day).

**Merge small clusters:**
- A cluster with < 2 commits and a low-signal message ("fix", "wip", "update", "misc")
  → absorb into the nearest related cluster, or promote to standalone

**Split large clusters:**
- A single scope with commits clearly spanning two unrelated feature areas
  → split into two issues if each part is independently releasable

**Naming issues from clusters:**
- Collapsed multi-scope cluster: title describes the shared feature ("Add {common theme}")
- Single scope cluster: title reflects the scope feature area ("Add {scope} skill/feature")
- Directory-based cluster (fallback): title reflects the directory's purpose

---

## Step 6 — Validate epics

An epic is only meaningful when it has a coherent scope that could have a real
Definition of Done. Three gates must all pass:

**Gate 1 — Minimum children:**
- Children ≥ 2 → pass
- Children = 1 → dissolve; child becomes standalone
- Children = 0 → discard (only trivials in window)

**Gate 2 — Maximum children:**
- Children ≤ 8 → pass
- Children > 8 → dissolve all children to standalone; this is a time bucket,
  not a feature. No Definition of Done could meaningfully cover 9+ independent
  deliverables.

**Gate 3 — Scope coherence:**
- Children span ≤ 3 distinct scopes → pass (coherent feature area)
- Children span ≥ 4 distinct unrelated scopes → dissolve all to standalone;
  this is a collection bucket formed by a temporal boundary, not a feature.

All three gates must pass. If any fails, dissolve the epic — promote all its
children to standalone issues.

**Practical consequence:** repos built in a short sprint with one or two weak
time boundaries (a tag, a single gap) will produce no epics at all. That is
correct — standalone issues grouped by scope are more honest than artificial
collection-bucket epics.

**Never create a single-child epic. Never create a time-bucket epic.**

---

## Step 7 — Write the proposal document

Write `docs/retro-issues.md` (create `docs/` if needed) using the structure in [proposal-format.md](proposal-format.md).

Use `#TBD` as the issue number placeholder — replaced with real numbers after creation. Every non-trivial commit must appear under exactly one ticket. The Excluded Commits table should be short — if it's long, re-examine the trivial classification.

Tell the user:
> Proposal written to `docs/retro-issues.md`.
> Review and edit it directly — adjust groupings, rename, merge, split,
> or remove sections as needed.
> When satisfied, say **YES** to create all issues on GitHub.

Wait. Accept:
- **YES** → read current `docs/retro-issues.md` state and proceed to Step 8
- Any edit instruction → apply to the file, confirm, wait again

---

## Step 8 — Create issues on GitHub

Read `docs/retro-issues.md` as the authoritative source. Create in this order —
never create in parallel, order matters for issue numbers.

**8a. Create epics:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{epic title}" \
  --label "epic,{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Overview
{Inferred from doc references and commit summary. 2–4 sentences.}

## Motivation
{What drove this phase of work.}

## Scope
{Filled in after child issues are created.}

## Definition of Done
{Inferred from what was actually delivered — observable outcomes.}

---
*Retrospectively created. Covers {start-date} → {end-date}.*
EOF
)"
```

Record each epic number. Update `#TBD` placeholders in `docs/retro-issues.md`.

**8b. Create child issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{child title}" \
  --label "{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Context
Part of epic #{epic-number} — {epic title}.
Retrospectively created. Covers {start-date} → {end-date}.
Key commits: {3–5 short hashes and messages}.

## What
{Inferred from commit messages and changed files. Outcome-focused.}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Observable outcome inferred from what was delivered}

## Notes
{ADR / blog entry / design doc reference if relevant. Primary file paths changed.}
EOF
)"
```

Close immediately:
```bash
gh issue close {number} --comment "Completed. Retrospectively created from git history."
```

**8c. Update each epic's Scope checklist** with real child issue numbers:
```bash
gh issue edit {epic-number} --body "..." --repo {owner/repo}
```

**8d. Create standalone issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{title}" \
  --label "{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Context
Retrospectively created. Standalone — not part of any epic.
Covers {date}. Key commits: {short hashes}.

## What
{Inferred from commit messages.}

## Notes
{Primary file paths changed.}
EOF
)"
gh issue close {number} --comment "Completed. Retrospectively created from git history."
```

---

## Step 9 — Summarise

```
✅ Retrospective mapping complete.

Created {N} epics, {N} child issues, {N} standalone issues.
All issues closed with retrospective note.

Epic summary:
  #{N} — {title} ({N} children)
  #{N} — {title} ({N} children)

Run `gh issue list --state closed --label epic` to review.
```

Then commit `docs/retro-issues.md` as a permanent audit trail:

```bash
git add docs/retro-issues.md
git commit -m "docs(retro-issues): retrospective issue mapping"
```

**Why keep it:** GitHub issues record outcomes; `docs/retro-issues.md` records the *reasoning* — how commits were grouped, what was excluded and why. Useful when re-running retro-issues later (avoids re-analysis) and when investigating why a commit isn't linked to a specific issue.

**Never delete it** and **never add it to `.gitignore`** — it is a permanent project artifact.

Then offer the optional commit-amendment step (Step 10).

---

## Step 10 (Optional) — Amend historical commit messages

Offered after Step 9. Rewrites git history to add `Refs #N` / `Closes #N` footers.
Requires team coordination and a force push. Load [step10-amend.md](step10-amend.md) for the full workflow.

---

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|---------|
| No ADRs, blog, or design doc | Pure gap-based analysis; note lower confidence in groupings |
| All commits in one time window | Skip epics; create issues and standalones only |
| Existing closed GitHub issues | Warn about potential duplicates before creating |
| Very large history (>500 commits) | Ask for date range before Step 2 |
| Commits with no useful message ("wip", "fix") | Use file paths as primary grouping signal; note low-confidence title in proposal |
| Monorepo with many unrelated areas | Ask which top-level directories to include before analysing |

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Large Excluded Commits table | Most commits should have a ticket; a big exclusion list means mis-classification | Re-examine anything beyond pure typos, whitespace, and merge commits |
| Commits with no ticket anywhere | Every non-trivial commit must appear under exactly one ticket | If it doesn't fit an existing cluster, it becomes a standalone |
| Creating issues before user approves proposal | Permanent GitHub records from wrong groupings | Always write retro-issues.md first; never create until YES |
| Single-child epic | No value over a standalone issue | Enforce 2-child minimum; dissolve during Step 6 |
| Treating trivial commits as issues | Noise in issue tracker | Classify first; trivials go to Excluded table only |
| Amending commits directly on main | If filter-repo fails mid-run, main is in unknown state | Always work on `retro-amended`; swap labels only after `git diff` confirms files identical |
| Amending without team coordination | Others' local history diverges silently | Show force-push warning; require explicit YES; give `reset --hard` instructions |

---

## Success Criteria

Retrospective mapping is complete when:
- ✅ `docs/retro-issues.md` written and user confirmed with YES
- ✅ `docs/retro-issues.md` committed as a permanent audit trail after issues are created
- ✅ All epics created with 2+ children (none with fewer)
- ✅ All child issues created, closed, and linked in epic Scope checklists
- ✅ All standalones created and closed
- ✅ All trivial commits listed in Excluded table with reasons
- ✅ If commit amendment chosen: `retro-amended` branch verified with `git diff`, labels swapped, `${branch}-pre-retro` backup retained until team re-synced

**Not complete** until all GitHub issues confirmed closed in `gh issue list`.

## Skill Chaining

**Invoked by:** User directly via `/retro-issues`, or says "map history to issues",
"backfill GitHub from git log", "retrospectively create issues".

**Prerequisite:** Run `issue-workflow` Phase 0 (Setup) first to configure standard
labels including `epic`. If labels are missing, the `--label "epic,..."` calls
will fail.

**Invokes:** Nothing — terminal skill.

**Never invoked automatically by:** `issue-workflow`, `git-commit`, Work Tracking,
or any session-start behaviour. Explicitly on-demand only.
