# Update CLAUDE.md

You are an expert at maintaining repository guidance documentation. Your job is
to keep CLAUDE.md accurate when workflows, conventions, or repository structure
changes.

## Purpose

**CLAUDE.md** documents how Claude Code should work in this repository:
- Build commands and development workflows
- Testing patterns and commands
- Naming conventions and code organization
- Repository-specific tools and processes
- Project conventions that aren't obvious from code

**Not covered here:** Software architecture (that's DESIGN.md via update-design)

## Core Rules

- CLAUDE.md lives at repository root
- **Never apply changes without explicit user confirmation** (a plain "YES" or equivalent)
- **Never modify the Project Type section** — this is user-configured and defines repository behavior (type: skills, type: java, type: blog, type: custom, type: generic)
- Focus on **workflow and convention changes**: new tools, build commands, testing
  patterns, naming conventions, repository structure changes
- Keep prose concise and professional. Prefer bullet points and tables
- Do not mention AI, LLMs, or tooling attribution in the document

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check if CLAUDE.md exists

```bash
ls CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No CLAUDE.md found"
```

- If found → proceed to Step 1a
- If not found → check if this is the type of repo that needs one:
  - Skills repository? (has */SKILL.md files)
  - Complex build setup? (has build.gradle, pom.xml, package.json, etc.)
  - If yes → propose creating starter CLAUDE.md from [starter-templates.md](starter-templates.md), ask user to confirm
  - If no → skip (repo may not need CLAUDE.md)

### Step 1a: Check for modular structure

Run `python scripts/document_discovery.py CLAUDE.md` (or use the API) to detect linked module files. **If modules exist**, switch to the [modular-handling.md](modular-handling.md) workflow for Steps 2, 5, and 6. Otherwise continue below.

### Step 2: Read current content

Read the full CLAUDE.md so you understand the existing structure before proposing changes.

### Step 3: Collect changes to analyze

In priority order:
1. **Staged changes**: `git diff --staged` (prefer this)
2. **Recent commit**: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` (if nothing staged)
3. **User-provided description** passed in context

### Step 4: Identify workflow/convention impact

Map changes to CLAUDE.md sections:

| Change type | Likely CLAUDE.md section |
|---|---|
| New build tool or command | Build/Development commands |
| New testing framework or test commands | Testing section |
| Package/module structure change | Repository Structure |
| New naming convention introduced | Naming Conventions |
| New development tool (linter, formatter) | Development Tools |
| CI/CD pipeline changes | Build/CI section |
| New environment variable required | Configuration/Setup |
| Git workflow changes (hooks, branch strategy) | Git Workflow |
| New skill added (skills repo) | Skill list, Naming Conventions |
| Skill renamed (skills repo) | Update all references |
| New skill cross-reference pattern (skills repo) | Editing Skills section |

**What to skip:**
- **Project Type section** — never modify this user-configured section
- Code implementation details (that's for DESIGN.md)
- Architecture changes (that's for DESIGN.md)
- Individual bug fixes that don't change workflow
- Formatting/style changes

### Step 4a: Check for framework changes (UNIVERSAL)

**Framework changes = infrastructure that affects multiple files or introduces new capabilities.**

**Red flags that warrant CLAUDE.md documentation:**

| Pattern | CLAUDE.md Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| **New scripts/ or tools/ files** | Document in Development Tools or Repository Structure |
| **New validation/testing infrastructure** | Document in Testing section or Quality Assurance |
| **Same pattern applied across multiple files** | Framework change, document the pattern |
| **New automation or sync capabilities** | Document in workflow sections |
| **New quality gates or pre-commit hooks** | Document in Git Workflow or Development Tools |
| **New dependency management patterns** | Document in Dependencies section |

**Example:**
- **What happened:** A new linter or validator added to the CI pipeline
- **Framework change:** All commits now require passing lint checks before merge
- **CLAUDE.md impact:** Should document the new quality gate under Development Tools or Workflow

**If you detect framework changes, include them in proposals even if no direct workflow/convention changes.**

**This check applies to ALL project types** (skills/java/blog/custom/generic).

### Step 4b: Check for missing Work Tracking section

```bash
grep -q "Issue tracking.*enabled" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "present" || echo "absent"
```

If absent, prompt:

> **Enable GitHub issue tracking for this repo? (YES / n)**
>
> Adds automatic behaviours: flag cross-cutting tasks before starting, check staged changes for commit splits, and link every commit to a GitHub issue for clean release notes.
>
> Default: **YES** — type **YES** to enable, type **n** to skip.

If **YES** → propose adding to CLAUDE.md (include in the Step 5 proposal block):
```markdown
## Work Tracking

**Issue tracking:** enabled
**GitHub repo:** [owner/repo]
**Changelog:** GitHub Releases (run `gh release create --generate-notes` at milestones)

**Automatic behaviours (Claude follows these when this section is present):**
- Before starting any significant task, check if it spans multiple concerns.
  If it does, help break it into separate issues before beginning work.
- When staging changes before a commit, check if they span multiple issues.
  If they do, suggest splitting the commit using `git add -p`.
```

Fill `[owner/repo]` from `git remote get-url origin`. This is a one-time addition — once present, this check passes silently.

If **n** → skip silently.

### Step 4c: Check for missing Writing Style Guide section

```bash
ls blog/ 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

If `blog/` exists (meaning write-blog has been used in this workspace), check whether CLAUDE.md already contains the Writing Style Guide requirement:

```bash
grep -l "writing style guide\|blog-technical" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
```

If `blog/` exists **and** the requirement is absent from CLAUDE.md, propose adding:

```markdown
## Writing Style Guide

**The writing style guide at `~/claude-workspace/writing-styles/blog-technical.md` is mandatory for all blog and diary entries.** Load it in full before drafting. Complete the pre-draft voice classification (I / we / Claude-named) before generating any prose. Do not show a draft without verifying it against the style guide.
```

This is a one-time addition per project — once present, this check passes silently.

### Step 5: Propose updates

**For single-file CLAUDE.md:**

Format each proposed change as a clear before/after block:

```
## Section: <Section Name>

**Replace:**
> <exact existing text, or "(new section)">

**With:**
> <your proposed replacement text>

**Reason:** <one-sentence rationale>
```

**For modular CLAUDE.md:** see [modular-handling.md](modular-handling.md) § Step 5.

Group related changes. Show summary at top if many changes.

### Step 6: Confirm and apply

End every proposal with exactly:

> **Does this look good?**
> Reply **YES** to apply all changes, **NO** to discard, or describe what to adjust.

When user confirms YES:

1. Apply **only** the proposed changes
2. **Validate the document:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_document.py CLAUDE.md
   ```
3. **If validation fails (exit code 1):**
   - Revert changes: `git restore CLAUDE.md`
   - Report CRITICAL issues to user; ask user to fix manually; stop (do not stage)
4. **If validation succeeds or has only warnings:**
   - Print brief summary: "✅ Updated sections: Build Commands, Testing"
   - Document is ready for staging

**For modular CLAUDE.md:** see [modular-handling.md](modular-handling.md) § Step 6.

**Validation checks for modular groups:**
- Link integrity: All `[links](file.md)` and `[links](file.md#section)` resolve
- Completeness: No orphaned modules (unreferenced from primary)
- No duplication: Substantial paragraphs not duplicated across files
- Individual file validation: Each file passes single-file corruption checks

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these mistakes when updating CLAUDE.md:

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Modifying Project Type section | Breaks repository behavior, user-configured | Never touch this section, skip it entirely |
| Applying changes without confirmation | User loses control | Always wait for explicit YES |
| Documenting architecture in CLAUDE.md | Wrong file - DESIGN.md is for architecture | Focus on workflow/conventions only |
| Over-documenting obvious things | Clutter, maintenance burden | Only document non-obvious workflows |
| Not updating CLAUDE.md when adding tools | Claude doesn't know about new tools | Update when workflow changes |
| Copying command help text verbatim | Duplicate of `--help` output | Summarize common use cases |

## Document Structure Check

*This check is part of the `performance` and `docs-sync` categories in `project-health`. For a full analysis: `/project-health performance docs-sync`. See [docs/project-health.md](../docs/project-health.md).*

After applying updates, run:

```bash
python scripts/validation/validate_doc_structure.py CLAUDE.md
```

If exit code 1 or 2, follow the nudge workflow described in `java-update-design` § Document Structure Check — same conversation, same threshold adjustment, same CLAUDE.md persistence pattern.

## Success Criteria

CLAUDE.md update is complete when:

- ✅ CLAUDE.md located and read
- ✅ Workflow/convention changes identified from staged diff
- ✅ Proposed updates formatted as before/after blocks
- ✅ User confirmed with explicit **YES**
- ✅ Changes applied to CLAUDE.md
- ✅ **Document validation passed** (no CRITICAL corruption)
- ✅ File ready for staging (or user confirmed no changes needed)

**Not complete until** all criteria met, validation passed, and CLAUDE.md reflects current workflows.

## Skill Chaining

**Invoked by:** [`git-commit`] when committing in any repository, [`java-git-commit`] alongside update-design, [`blog-git-commit`] when committing blog changes, [`custom-git-commit`] when committing custom project changes, [`handover`] as part of the session wrap checklist (syncs new conventions before the handover is written), [`write-blog`] on the first blog entry ever in a project (adds the mandatory Writing Style Guide section)

**Invokes:** None (terminal skill in the chain)

**Can be invoked independently:** User can run `/update-claude-md` directly to sync CLAUDE.md without committing

**Starter templates:** see [starter-templates.md](starter-templates.md) — used when creating CLAUDE.md from scratch.
