# java-project-health — Design Document

**Status:** Design phase — not yet implemented as a skill
**Skill name (planned):** `java-project-health`
**Slash command (planned):** `/java-project-health`
**Invoked by:** [`project-health`](project-health.md) when `type: java` declared in CLAUDE.md

This document tracks the Java-specific health checks that augment the universal checks in `project-health`.

---

## Purpose

Runs after `project-health` completes its universal checks. Adds Java/Maven/Gradle-specific correctness and refinement checks that only make sense for Java projects.

Follows the same pattern as `java-git-commit` extending `git-commit`.

---

## Prerequisite

**This skill builds on [`project-health`](project-health.md).** When invoked directly (e.g. `/java-project-health`), it runs all universal checks first then its own additions — identical output to `project-health` auto-chaining to this skill. Either entry point produces the same result.

---

## Augmentations to Universal Checks

These extend the universal categories with Java-specific items:

| Universal check | Quality additions | Refinement additions |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `primary-doc` | DESIGN.md exists and reflects current architecture; no stale entity/service/repository references | Could DESIGN.md be split into focused modules (architecture, API, data model)? |
| `artifacts` | `docs/DESIGN.md` exists (java-git-commit blocks without it) | Is DESIGN.md appropriately sized, or has it grown beyond a single file? |
| `conventions` | BOM strategy documented; commit scopes consistent (rest/service/repository/bom/config) | Could BOM documentation be more concise? Are scope conventions clear? |
| `framework` | No blocking JDBC on Vert.x event loop; @Blocking annotations correct; CDI injection patterns correct; no raw JDBC outside repositories | Could Quarkus/Vert.x concurrency guidance be better grouped? |

## Java-Specific Categories

These categories only exist for Java projects and are not present in `project-health`:

### `java-architecture` — Architecture Integrity

**Quality** — Is the Java architecture clean and consistent?
- [ ] Layer separation respected (no direct calls from controller to repository)
- [ ] Domain model classes are not leaking into API layer
- [ ] @Entity classes are not used as API request/response types
- [ ] No circular imports between packages
- [ ] Service classes do not hold mutable state shared across requests
- [ ] No business logic in @Entity or @Repository classes — logic belongs in services
- [ ] No cyclic package dependencies (com.app.order → com.app.payment → com.app.order)

**Refinement** — Could the architecture be simpler or better expressed?
- [ ] Are there service classes doing too many things that could be split?
- [ ] Are there utility classes that have grown into mini-services?
- [ ] Could any layer boundaries be made clearer through package structure?

### `java-dependencies` — Maven/Gradle Dependency Health

**Quality** — Are dependencies correct and aligned?
- [ ] All dependencies in BOM — no explicit versions where BOM manages them
- [ ] No version overrides without documented reason
- [ ] No duplicate dependencies via transitive resolution
- [ ] Test dependencies scoped correctly (not leaking to runtime)
- [ ] `annotationProcessorPaths` includes all required processors
- [ ] BOM overrides don't create runtime mismatches with transitive dependencies
- [ ] No test-scoped dependency accidentally used in production code

**Refinement** — Could the dependency structure be leaner?
- [ ] Are there dependencies used in only one place that could be removed?
- [ ] Are there large dependencies used for one small feature?
- [ ] Are there test-scoped dependencies that overlap with production utilities already on the classpath?

### `java-code-quality` — Code Duplication & Extraction Opportunities

**Quality** — Is there code that should be shared but isn't?
- [ ] The same logic block appears 3+ times across the codebase — high risk because a fix in one copy is silently missed in others
- [ ] Similar but not identical methods that should be parameterised and unified
- [ ] Hardcoded values (strings, numbers, paths) repeated across multiple classes — should be named constants or config
- [ ] Repeated sequences of calls that always appear together and belong in a helper method or utility class
- [ ] Repeated string literals across classes (status codes, event names, field names) that should be constants
- [ ] Callback or listener patterns repeated 3+ times that should share a base class or interface

**Refinement** — Could small refactorings make code more shareable and reduce duplication going forward?
- [ ] Are there methods just over the threshold for extraction — a small refactor would make them reusable?
- [ ] Are there classes that have grown to mix concerns, where splitting would naturally isolate reusable logic?
- [ ] Are there utility-style methods sitting inside domain classes that could be extracted to a shared utility?
- [ ] Are there parallel implementations across different modules that evolved independently but now do the same thing?
- [ ] Are there abstract base classes or interfaces that would capture shared behaviour if added now?

## Output Format

Same severity rating as `project-health`, prefixed with `[java]`:

```
### HIGH (should fix)
- [java][framework] OrderService.findAll() makes JDBC call on Vert.x event loop — add @Blocking
- [java][java-architecture] PaymentController calls PaymentRepository directly, bypassing service layer
```
