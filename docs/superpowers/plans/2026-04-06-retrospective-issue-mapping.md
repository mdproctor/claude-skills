# Retrospective Issue Mapping Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create a standalone `retro-issues` skill that analyses git history and available documents to propose a structured epic/issue hierarchy for approval, then creates everything on GitHub in one batch.

**Architecture:** A new skill `retro-issues/` with its own `SKILL.md`, bundled scripts, and slash command. It is invoked only explicitly via `/retro-issues` — never auto-triggered. It runs in three stages: Gather (read-only analysis), Propose (write `docs/retro-issues.md` for review), Create (batch GitHub issue creation on user confirmation). Nothing is created until the user approves.

**Why separate from `issue-workflow`:** `issue-workflow` enforces discipline throughout every development session. `retro-issues` is a one-off archaeological operation run once per repository on demand. Mixing them would pollute issue-workflow's always-on triggers with a command-only concern.

**Tech Stack:** `gh` CLI, `git log` with structured format, markdown document reading, `git-filter-repo` (optional, for commit message amendment).

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Epic validity rule
**A single-child epic has no value.** Any grouping with fewer than two child issues is demoted to a standalone issue. Enforced during proposal generation, before anything is shown to the user.

### Trivial commit exclusion
Commits are excluded from ticket creation (but listed in the proposal document) when they are purely trivial: formatting, whitespace, typos, merge commits. They get no ticket — not even standalone. Dependency bumps DO get a standalone ticket.

### The proposal document
Before any GitHub call, the full proposed structure is written to `docs/retro-issues.md`. The user reviews and edits the file directly. When satisfied, they say YES and Claude reads the current file state to drive creation. This decouples review from the conversation.

### Safety model
Entirely read-only until the user says YES. Git history is never modified by the main flow. The optional commit-amendment step is separate, gated, and requires explicit coordination acknowledgement.

### Creation order
Epics first → children (need epic numbers for Context sections) → update epic Scope checklists → standalones. All created as closed.

## Files to Create / Modify

**Create (new skill):**
- `retro-issues/SKILL.md`
- `retro-issues/scripts/retro-parse-mapping.py`
- `retro-issues/scripts/retro-amend-commits.py`
- `retro-issues/commands/retro-issues.md` (slash command — via `generate_commands.py`)

**Modify (integration):**
- `issue-workflow/SKILL.md` — replace Step 6 stub with pointer to `/retro-issues`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — add `retro-issues` to plugins list
- `README.md` — add `retro-issues` skill entry
- `CLAUDE.md` — add `retro-issues` to Key Skills

---

## Task 1: Design the analysis algorithm

Design-only — no files written. Output is the algorithm used in Task 3.

- [ ] **Step 1: Understand the input sources**

The algorithm reads sources in priority order:

```
Priority 1 — Documents (define phase/epic boundaries):
  docs/adr/           → each ADR = a significant architectural decision
  docs/diary/ blog/   → project blog entries with phase narrative
  DESIGN.md           → feature areas and component boundaries
  HANDOVER.md         → session context snapshots (secondary)

Priority 2 — Git log (fills in issues within each phase):
  git log --no-merges --format="%H|%ad|%s" --date=short
  git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only {hash}

Priority 3 — Tags and branch names (phase boundaries):
  git tag -l --sort=version:refname
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Understand the grouping heuristics**

```
PHASE BOUNDARY DETECTION (epic candidates):
  - Each ADR date → check commits within ±3 days → likely a milestone
  - Blog entry dates with "complete", "shipped", "done", "phase", "v1" → milestone
  - Git tags → milestone
  - Gaps >7 days with no commits → natural phase break
  - Result: N time windows, each a candidate epic

TRIVIAL EXCLUSIONS (no ticket at all — listed in Excluded Commits table only):
  - Formatting/whitespace ("format", "whitespace", "indent", "trailing")
  - Typo fixes ("typo", "fix typo", "spelling")
  - Merge commits
  - Single-line config tweaks with no functional impact

ISSUE GROUPING (within each time window, non-trivial commits only):
  - Cluster by top-level directory of changed files
    e.g. all commits touching skills/java-dev/ → "Java dev skill" issue
  - Merge clusters < 2 commits with trivial-ish messages → standalone
  - Split clusters touching 3+ unrelated directories → separate issues

STANDALONE DETECTION (gets a ticket, no parent epic):
  - Dependency bumps ("bump", "upgrade X to Y.Z")
  - Small isolated changes that don't cluster with anything
  - Groups dissolved from single-child epics

EPIC VALIDATION:
  - Children ≥ 2 → keep as epic
  - Children = 1 → dissolve; child becomes standalone
  - Children = 0 → discard (only trivials)
  - Never create a single-child epic
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Understand the proposal document format**

```markdown
# Retrospective Issue Mapping
Generated: {date}
Repo: {owner/repo}
Scope: {earliest-date} → {latest-date} | {N} commits analysed

---

## Epics and Child Issues

### Epic: "{title}" [enhancement]
Period: {start-date} → {end-date}
References: {ADR-NNNN / blog entry date / none}

#### Issue #TBD: "{child title}" [enhancement]
Commits:
- `{short-hash}` {date} — {message}
- `{short-hash}` {date} — {message}
Primary area: `{directory/}`

#### Issue #TBD: "{child title}" [bug]
Commits:

### Epic: "{title}" [enhancement]
...

---

## Standalone Issues

### Issue #TBD: "{title}" [enhancement]
Commits:

Primary area: `{directory/}`

---

## Excluded Commits (no ticket created)

| Hash | Date | Message | Reason |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `{hash}` | {date} | {message} | Formatting/whitespace only |
| `{hash}` | {date} | {message} | Typo fix |
| `{hash}` | {date} | {message} | Merge commit |

---
*Edit this document to adjust groupings, rename issues, merge or split clusters,
or move commits between issues. When satisfied, say YES to create all on GitHub.*
```

`#TBD` placeholders are replaced with real issue numbers after creation.

---

## Task 2: Write and bundle Phase R scripts

Scripts must be bundled inside `retro-issues/scripts/` — installed to
`~/.claude/skills/retro-issues/scripts/` — so marketplace users have them.
Referenced in the skill as absolute paths using that location.

**Files:**
- Create: `retro-issues/scripts/retro-parse-mapping.py`
- Create: `retro-issues/scripts/retro-amend-commits.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `retro-parse-mapping.py`**

Parses `docs/retro-issues.md` and emits JSON `{ "short_hash": "Refs #N" }`.
Last commit per issue gets `Closes #N`; all others `Refs #N`. Excluded commits omitted.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""

## Task 3: Write `retro-issues` SKILL.md

**Files:**
- Create: `retro-issues/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the full SKILL.md**

```markdown
---
name: retro-issues
description: >
  Use when mapping an existing git repository's history to GitHub epics and
  issues — user says "map our history to issues", "retrospectively create
  issues", "backfill GitHub from git log", or invokes /retro-issues.
  One-off, on-demand only. Never auto-triggered.
---

# Retro Issues

Maps a repository's git history to a structured set of GitHub epics and issues.
Run once per repository when issue tracking is being introduced retrospectively.

**This skill is invoked only explicitly.** It is never auto-triggered by
Work Tracking or any other automatic behaviour. Use `issue-workflow` for
ongoing lifecycle enforcement.

## Safety contract

All git operations are read-only until the user confirms with YES.
Git history is never modified by the main flow.
The optional commit-amendment step is separate, gated, and destructive — it
requires explicit team coordination acknowledgement before proceeding.

---

## Step 1 — Check prerequisites

```bash
git remote get-url origin   # needs a GitHub remote
gh auth status              # needs gh CLI authenticated
```

Extract `owner/repo`. If either fails, stop and tell the user.

Check for a very large history and offer to scope it:
```bash
git rev-list --count HEAD
```

If > 500 commits:
> This repo has {N} commits. Analysing all of them may produce too many
> groupings to review comfortably.
>
> Scope options:
> - **Date range** — e.g. "from 2024-01-01"
> - **Last N commits** — e.g. "last 200 commits"
> - **All** — proceed with full history

Wait for user choice before continuing.

Check for existing closed issues to avoid duplication:
```bash
gh issue list --state closed --limit 10 --repo {owner/repo}
```

If closed issues exist, warn:
> This repo already has {N} closed issues. The retrospective will propose new
> issues for the git history — review carefully to avoid duplicates.

---

## Step 2 — Gather inputs

**Git history:**
```bash
git log --no-merges \
  --format="%H|%ad|%s" \
  --date=short \
  {--after="{date}" if scoped}
```

For each commit hash, get changed files:
```bash
git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only {hash}
```

**Tags (phase boundary signals):**
```bash
git tag -l --sort=version:refname
```

**Documents (read each that exists):**
```bash
ls docs/adr/ 2>/dev/null
ls docs/diary/ blog/ 2>/dev/null
cat DESIGN.md 2>/dev/null
```

For each ADR: extract its date and title.
For each blog/diary entry: extract date and any milestone language
("complete", "shipped", "done", "phase", "v1").

---

## Step 3 — Identify phase boundaries

Build a timeline from commit dates. Mark boundary candidates:

| Signal | How to detect |
|--------|--------------|
| ADR created | ADR file date within ±3 days of commits |
| Blog milestone | Blog entry date + milestone language near commit cluster |
| Git tag | Tag date |
| Commit gap | >7 days with no commits between clusters |

Group commits into time windows between boundaries. Each window is a candidate
epic. Name it from the dominant document context (ADR title, blog phase name)
or from the most-changed directory within it.

If no boundaries are found: skip the epic layer entirely — create issues and
standalones only.

---

## Step 4 — Classify commits

For each commit, classify before grouping:

**Trivial (no ticket):**
- Message matches: "typo", "whitespace", "indent", "trailing", "format", "spelling"
- Is a merge commit

**Dependency bump (standalone ticket):**
- Message matches: "bump", "upgrade X to Y.Z", "update X to"

**Functional (cluster into issues):**
- Everything else

---

## Step 5 — Cluster functional commits into issues

Within each time window, group functional commits by the top-level directory
of their changed files.

Merge a cluster into standalone if:
- It has < 2 commits AND message is low-signal ("fix", "wip", "update", "misc")

Split a cluster into two issues if:
- It touches 3+ clearly unrelated top-level directories

---

## Step 6 — Validate epics

For each candidate epic:
- Children ≥ 2 → keep as epic
- Children = 1 → dissolve; child becomes standalone
- Children = 0 → discard

**Never create a single-child epic.**

---

## Step 7 — Write the proposal document

Write `docs/retro-issues.md` (create `docs/` if needed). Use `#TBD` as
the issue number placeholder — replaced with real numbers after creation.

Structure: Epics (with child issues listed beneath) → Standalone Issues
→ Excluded Commits table.

Tell the user:
> Proposal written to `docs/retro-issues.md`.
> Review and edit it directly — adjust groupings, rename, merge, split,
> or remove sections as needed.
> When satisfied, say **YES** to create all issues on GitHub.

Wait. Accept:
- **YES** → read current `docs/retro-issues.md` state and proceed to Step 8
- Any edit instruction → apply to the file, confirm, wait again

---

## Step 8 — Create issues on GitHub

Read `docs/retro-issues.md` as the authoritative source. Create in order:

**8a. Create epics:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{epic title}" \
  --label "epic,{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Overview
{Inferred from doc references and commit summary.}

## Motivation
{What drove this phase of work.}

## Scope
{Filled in after child issues are created.}

## Definition of Done
{Inferred from what was actually delivered — observable outcomes.}

---
*Retrospectively created. Covers {start-date} → {end-date}.*
EOF
)"
```

Record each epic number. Update `#TBD` placeholders in `docs/retro-issues.md`.

**8b. Create child issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{child title}" \
  --label "{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Context
Part of epic #{epic-number} — {epic title}.
Retrospectively created. Covers {start-date} → {end-date}.
Key commits: {3–5 short hashes and messages}.

### What
{Inferred from commit messages and changed files. Outcome-focused.}

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Observable outcome inferred from what was delivered}

### Notes
{ADR / blog entry / design doc reference if relevant. Primary file paths changed.}
EOF
)"
```

Close immediately:
```bash
gh issue close {number} --comment "Completed. Retrospectively created from git history."
```

**8c. Update each epic's Scope checklist** with real child issue numbers.

**8d. Create standalone issues:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "{title}" \
  --label "{type-label}" \
  --repo {owner/repo} \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Context
Retrospectively created. Standalone — not part of any epic.
Covers {date}. Key commits: {short hashes}.

### What
{Inferred from commit messages.}

### Notes
{Primary file paths changed.}
EOF
)"
gh issue close {number} --comment "Completed. Retrospectively created from git history."
```

---

## Step 9 — Summarise

```
✅ Retrospective mapping complete.

Created {N} epics, {N} child issues, {N} standalone issues.
All issues closed with retrospective note.

Epic summary:
  #{N} — {title} ({N} children)
  #{N} — {title} ({N} children)

Run `gh issue list --state closed --label epic` to review.
```

Then offer the optional commit-amendment step (Step 10).

---

## Step 10 (Optional) — Amend historical commit messages

Offered after Step 9. Rewrites git history to add `Refs #N` / `Closes #N`
footers to commits. Requires team coordination.

Ask:
> Would you also like to amend historical commit messages to reference their issues?
>
> ⚠️ This rewrites git history and requires a force push.
>    Safe only when all contributors can be coordinated to re-pull.
>
> YES — proceed | NO — skip

If NO: done. If YES:

**Check git-filter-repo:**
```bash
git filter-repo --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT INSTALLED"
```

If missing: `brew install git-filter-repo` or `pip3 install git-filter-repo`.

**Identify current branch:**
```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
echo "Working from: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
```

**Create an amendment branch — do not touch the current branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b retro-amended
```

`main` (or whatever `$CURRENT_BRANCH` is) is now untouched. All rewriting
happens on `retro-amended`. If anything goes wrong, `git branch -D retro-amended`
discards all changes cleanly.

**Generate mapping JSON:**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/retro-issues/scripts/retro-parse-mapping.py \
  docs/retro-issues.md > /tmp/retro-mapping.json
```

**Preview what will be amended** — show a table of commit → ref before proceeding:

```
Commits to be amended:

  abc1234  2024-01-15  "Add java-dev skill"    → + Refs #12
  def5678  2024-01-18  "Add java-dev tests"    → + Closes #12
  ghi9012  2024-02-01  "Add code-review skill" → + Closes #13

{N} commits will be amended. {M} excluded commits untouched.

Proceed? (YES / NO)
```

Wait for YES before running filter-repo.

**Run amendment on `retro-amended` only:**
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/retro-issues/scripts/retro-amend-commits.py \
  /tmp/retro-mapping.json
```

filter-repo rewrites `retro-amended`. `$CURRENT_BRANCH` is untouched.

**Verify the amendment branch:**
```bash
# Check messages have refs
git log retro-amended --oneline | head -10

# Critical safety check: file content must be identical
git diff $CURRENT_BRANCH retro-amended
```

If `git diff` produces any output: something went wrong — abort:
```bash
git checkout $CURRENT_BRANCH
git branch -D retro-amended
```

Tell the user and stop. If `git diff` is empty, continue.

**Swap the branch labels:**
```bash
# Rename original to a backup label
git branch -m $CURRENT_BRANCH ${CURRENT_BRANCH}-pre-retro

# Rename amendment branch to take the original name
git branch -m retro-amended $CURRENT_BRANCH
```

Now:
- `$CURRENT_BRANCH` → rewritten history with issue refs (active)
- `${CURRENT_BRANCH}-pre-retro` → original history, untouched (backup)

**Force push with lease:**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
```

**Coordinate team re-sync:**
> ⚠️ History rewritten and pushed.
>
> All contributors must re-sync their local copies:
>
>   git fetch origin
>   git checkout {branch}
>   git reset --hard origin/{branch}
>
> Do NOT use `git pull` — it will create a merge commit against the old history.

**Offer cleanup of backup:**
> The original history is preserved locally as `${CURRENT_BRANCH}-pre-retro`.
>
> Delete it now? **(YES / keep it for now)**

```bash
# If YES:
git branch -D ${CURRENT_BRANCH}-pre-retro
rm /tmp/retro-mapping.json
```

If kept: the user can delete it later with
`git branch -D ${CURRENT_BRANCH}-pre-retro` once the team is re-synced.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|---------|
| No ADRs, blog, or design doc | Pure git analysis; note lower confidence |
| All commits in one time window | Skip epics; create issues and standalones only |
| Existing closed GitHub issues | Warn about potential duplicates before creating |
| Very large history (>500 commits) | Ask for date range before Step 2 |
| Commits with no useful message ("wip", "fix") | Use file paths as primary grouping signal |
| Monorepo with many unrelated areas | Ask which top-level directories to include |

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Creating issues before user approves proposal | Permanent GitHub records created from wrong groupings | Always write retro-issues.md first; never create until YES |
| Single-child epic | Provides no value over a standalone issue | Enforce 2-child minimum; dissolve during Step 6 |
| Treating trivial commits as issues | Noise in issue tracker | Classify first; trivials go to Excluded table only |
| Amending commits directly on main | If filter-repo fails mid-run, main is corrupt | Always work on `retro-amended`; swap labels only after `git diff` confirms files identical |
| Amending without team coordination | Others' local history diverges silently | Show force-push warning; require explicit YES; give `reset --hard` instructions |

---

## Success Criteria

Retrospective mapping is complete when:
- ✅ `docs/retro-issues.md` written and user confirmed with YES
- ✅ All epics created with 2+ children (none with fewer)
- ✅ All child issues created, closed, and linked in epic Scope checklists
- ✅ All standalones created and closed
- ✅ All trivial commits listed in Excluded table with reasons
- ✅ If commit amendment chosen: `retro-amended` branch created and verified, labels swapped, `${branch}-pre-retro` backup retained until team confirms re-synced

**Not complete** until all GitHub issues are confirmed closed in `gh issue list`.

**Prerequisite:** `issue-workflow` Phase 0 (Setup) should have been run first
to configure labels (including `epic`) and Work Tracking. If not, Phase 10
will fail without the `epic` label.

**Invokes:** Nothing — terminal skill.

**Not invoked automatically by:** `issue-workflow`, `git-commit`, or any
Work Tracking behaviour. Explicitly on-demand only.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Generate the slash command file**

```bash
cd /Users/mdproctor/claude/skills
python3 scripts/generate_commands.py
```

Verify `retro-issues/commands/retro-issues.md` was created.

---

## Task 4: Update `issue-workflow` Step 6 stub

**Files:**
- Modify: `issue-workflow/SKILL.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace the thin Step 6 with a pointer**

Find the current "Step 6 — Past work reconstruction" section and replace it:

```markdown
### Step 6 — Past work reconstruction (if user chose option 2)

Use the `/retro-issues` skill for retrospective mapping of git history to
epics and issues. It is a dedicated on-demand command that analyses git log,
ADRs, blog entries, and design docs to propose a structured hierarchy before
creating anything on GitHub.
```

---

## Task 5: Update marketplace and docs

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — add `retro-issues`
- Modify: `README.md` — add `retro-issues` skill entry
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` — add `retro-issues` to Key Skills

- [ ] **Step 1: Add to marketplace.json**

Find the `plugins` array and add:
```json
{
  "name": "retro-issues",
  "description": "Map git history to GitHub epics and issues retrospectively",
  "category": "workflow"
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add to README.md**

In the workflow skills section (near `issue-workflow`), add:

```markdown
#### **retro-issues**
One-off retrospective mapping of git history to GitHub epics and issues:
- Analyses git log, ADRs, blog entries, and design docs to detect phase boundaries
- Groups functional commits into issues by directory; trivials excluded with reasons
- Enforces 2-child minimum for epics — single-child candidates demoted to standalone
- Writes full proposed structure to `docs/retro-issues.md` for review and editing
- Creates all issues as closed, in order: epics → children → standalones
- Optional: amends historical commit messages with `Refs #N` / `Closes #N` via `git-filter-repo`

**Triggers:** `/retro-issues` only. Never auto-triggered.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add to CLAUDE.md Key Skills**

In the `## Key Skills` section under workflow integrators, add:

```markdown
- `retro-issues` — on-demand retrospective mapping of git history to epics and issues; analyses git log + ADRs + blog entries; proposes structure in `docs/retro-issues.md` for review before creating anything on GitHub
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Validate docs**

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_document.py README.md
python3 scripts/validate_document.py CLAUDE.md
python3 scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit
```

Expected: all pass.

---

## Test Strategy

**Tests must be entirely self-contained.** No test may reference `~/claude`
or any path outside this repository at runtime. The `~/claude` repos are the
source of the test data, not a runtime dependency.

Two complementary approaches, run together via `pytest`:

**A — Synthetic git repos** for algorithm edge cases. Test setup code creates
minimal git repos programmatically using `git init` + `git commit`. Fully
deterministic, covers corner cases that may not appear in real repos.

**B — Extracted snapshots** from `~/claude` repos, committed into this repo.
A one-time developer tool (`scripts/generate_retro_fixtures.py`) extracts
`git log` output, changed-file lists, and doc files from each repo and writes
them to `tests/fixtures/retro/repos/`. That output is committed here and
becomes the permanent static test data. The `~/claude` repos are never
accessed at test runtime — they may not exist, may have changed, or may be
on a different machine entirely.

| Repo fixture | Commits | Key signals | What it tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skills` | 277 | 10 ADRs | ADR boundary detection, rich history |
| `permuplate` | 171 | 4 ADRs | ADR boundaries, Java codebase patterns |
| `scelight` | 140 | none | Pure gap-based boundary detection |
| `cccli` | 102 | 7 blog entries | Blog-entry boundary detection |
| `remotecc` | 84 | none | Medium repo, session-handoff commit style |
| `sparge` | 23 | 4 ADRs | Small repo, ADR-rich relative to size |
| `alpha` | 10 | none | Edge case: too small for any epics |
| `quarkusai` | 7 | none | Edge case: tiny, all standalone |

**What integration tests verify (structural properties, not exact output):**
- No single-child epics in any fixture
- Every non-trivial commit appears in exactly one issue's commit list
- Every trivial commit appears in the Excluded table
- Epic count is within a plausible range for the repo's size and boundary signals
- Issues have non-empty What, Context, and Notes sections

**What unit tests verify (exact output):**
- Parser: fixture `retro-issues.md` files → exact JSON mapping
- Trivial classifier: commit messages → correct trivial/standalone/functional category
- Epic validator: child counts → correct dissolve/keep decisions

---

## Task 6: Write fixture generation script

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/generate_retro_fixtures.py`

**This is a one-time developer tool, not part of the test suite.**

It runs once on a machine that has the `~/claude` repos, extracts the data
needed for tests, and writes it to `tests/fixtures/retro/repos/`. That
output is then committed to this repository. After that, the script and the
`~/claude` repos play no further role — all tests run against the committed
fixtures and never touch anything outside this repo.

The script is kept in `scripts/` so the extraction can be re-run deliberately
(e.g. to add a new repo fixture), but it is never called by `pytest` or CI.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `generate_retro_fixtures.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
ONE-TIME developer tool: extract retro-issues test fixtures from ~/claude repos.

Run this once on a machine that has ~/claude. Commit the output to
tests/fixtures/retro/repos/. Tests never call this script — they use
the committed fixtures directly.

Usage: python3 scripts/generate_retro_fixtures.py
Output: tests/fixtures/retro/repos/{repo-name}/
  git_log.jsonl       — one JSON object per line: {hash, date, subject}
  file_changes.json   — {hash: [changed_file_paths]}

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit the fixtures into this repository**

The extracted fixtures are permanent test data. Commit them here so that
all tests run self-contained, with no dependency on `~/claude` or any
external path.

Check size before staging — `file_changes.json` can be large for repos
with many files per commit:
```bash
du -sh tests/fixtures/retro/repos/*/file_changes.json | sort -h
```

If any exceeds 1MB, re-run the generator with a commit limit for that repo
(add a `--max-commits 200` flag to `generate_retro_fixtures.py`) then
re-check sizes.

Stage and commit:
```bash
git add tests/fixtures/retro/
git commit -m "test(retro-issues): add repo fixtures extracted from ~/claude"
```

After this commit, the `~/claude` repos are no longer needed by any test.
CI and any other machine can run the full test suite using only this repo.

            cwd=repo, check=True, capture_output=True,
            env={**os.environ, "GIT_COMMITTER_DATE": f"{date}T12:00:00"}
        )

    import os

    dated_commit("feat: add parser module", ["parser/core.py"], "2024-01-05")
    dated_commit("feat: add parser tests", ["parser/test_core.py"], "2024-01-07")

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run all tests**

```bash
cd /Users/mdproctor/claude/skills
python3 -m pytest tests/test_retro_parser.py tests/test_retro_analysis.py -v
```

Expected: all tests pass. Fix any import errors (add `import os`, `import subprocess`
to `test_retro_analysis.py` where needed).

---

## Task 9 (Optional): Amend historical commit messages

Handled entirely within the skill (Step 10). The bundled scripts in
`retro-issues/scripts/` are what make this work. No additional implementation
needed beyond what was written in Task 2.

---

## Task 10: Commit and sync

- [ ] **Step 1: Stage all new and modified files**

```bash
git add retro-issues/ issue-workflow/SKILL.md .claude-plugin/marketplace.json README.md CLAUDE.md \
  scripts/generate_retro_fixtures.py tests/fixtures/retro/ \
  tests/test_retro_parser.py tests/test_retro_analysis.py
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(retro-issues): add retrospective git history → epics/issues skill

New standalone skill for one-off mapping of git history to GitHub epics
and issues. Separate from issue-workflow by design — retro-issues is
explicitly on-demand; issue-workflow enforces lifecycle discipline.

Key behaviour:
- Documents (ADRs, blog, DESIGN.md) define epic phase boundaries
- Commits clustered into issues by directory within each phase window
- Trivial commits (format/typo/merge) excluded; listed with reasons
- Single-child epics dissolved to standalone — never created
- Proposal written to docs/retro-issues.md for review before any gh calls
- All historical issues created as closed in order: epics, children, standalones
- Optional commit amendment via bundled git-filter-repo scripts

Bundles retro-parse-mapping.py and retro-amend-commits.py in skill scripts/.
Updates issue-workflow Step 6 stub to point here."
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Sync local**

```bash
python3 scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y
```

Expected: 46/46 skills synced (one new skill added).

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage:**
- ✅ Separate skill, not part of issue-workflow → plan header + Task 3 Step 1 trigger section
- ✅ Command-only, never auto-triggered → stated in SKILL.md trigger section and Skill Chaining
- ✅ Uses git history + ADRs + blogs + design docs → Task 3 Step 2 (gather inputs)
- ✅ Groups commits to issues → Task 3 Step 5 (clustering)
- ✅ Groups issues to epics → Task 3 Step 3 (phase boundaries)
- ✅ Standalone tickets → Task 3 Steps 4–6 (classification + validation)
- ✅ No single-child epics → Task 3 Step 6 (epic validation, enforced)
- ✅ Trivial commits excluded, listed with reasons → Task 3 Step 4 + proposal format
- ✅ Proposal document (retro-issues.md) written first → Task 3 Step 7
- ✅ Nothing created until YES → safety contract + Step 7 gate
- ✅ Scripts bundled in skill → Task 2
- ✅ Optional commit amendment → Task 3 Step 10 + bundled scripts
- ✅ Tests — parser unit tests → Task 7 (7 test cases, fixture files)
- ✅ Tests — integration against real repos → Task 6 (fixture generator) + Task 8 (invariant tests)
- ✅ Tests — synthetic edge cases → Task 8 (single-child dissolved, gap detection)
- ✅ All ~/claude repos used as fixtures → Task 6 scans all repos under ~/claude

**Placeholder scan:** No TBD, TODO, or "implement later" present. All commands
are concrete. Script code is complete.

**Type consistency:** `short_hash` (str key in JSON) → `bytes` key in Python
callback — handled by `load_mapping()` encoding in `retro-amend-commits.py`.
Parser returns `str` keys; amender converts to `bytes`. Consistent.
