# project-health — Design Document

**Status:** Design phase — not yet implemented as a skill
**Skill name (planned):** `project-health`
**Slash command (planned):** `/project-health`
**Companion skill:** [`project-refine`](project-refine.md) — dedicated improvement and bloat reduction
**Type-specific skills:** [`java-project-health`](java-project-health.md) · [`blog-project-health`](blog-project-health.md) · [`custom-project-health`](custom-project-health.md) · [`skills-project-health`](skills-project-health.md)

This document tracks the design and scope of the `project-health` skill. It is a working document — update it as the skill evolves.

---

## Purpose

Answers the question: **is the project correct, complete, and consistent?**

`project-health` covers the **universal checks** that apply to every project type. It detects the project type from CLAUDE.md and routes to the appropriate type-specific skill for additional checks — exactly the same pattern as `git-commit` routing to `java-git-commit`, `blog-git-commit`, and `custom-git-commit`.

This keeps each skill focused: `project-health` is truly universal, type-specific skills contain only what is specific to their type, and there is no mixing.

It replaces:
- "make sure docs and code are in sync"
- "check for duplications, conflicts, gaps"
- "look for potential bugs or poor UX"
- pre-release system reviews

Other skills can reference specific check categories when they need things verified.

---

## Routing

After running universal checks, `project-health` routes to the type-specific skill based on `## Project Type` in CLAUDE.md:

| Project type | Routes to |
|---|---|
| `java` | [`java-project-health`](java-project-health.md) |
| `blog` | [`blog-project-health`](blog-project-health.md) |
| `custom` | [`custom-project-health`](custom-project-health.md) |
| `skills` | [`skills-project-health`](skills-project-health.md) |
| `generic` | No routing — universal checks only |

Type-specific skills run their own categories and augment the universal categories with type-specific checks. They are invocable directly (e.g. `/java-project-health`) or automatically via routing from `project-health`.

---

## Relationship with project-refine

`project-health` and [`project-refine`](project-refine.md) are companion skills designed to work together:

| | `project-health` | `project-refine` |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Question** | Is it correct? | Could it be better? |
| **Output** | CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW findings | 🔴🟡🟢 bloat score opportunities |
| **Mindset** | Pass / fail | Improvement suggestions |
| **Runs at** | Every commit (subset), pre-release, on demand | Periodic sessions, on demand |
| **Blocks work?** | CRITICAL findings should block release | Never blocks — always advisory |
| **Refinement notes** | ✅ Within each category (domain-specific) | ✅ Across docs, code, and tests |

**Using them together:**

```bash
# 1. Verify correctness first
/project-health --prerelease

# 2. Once health is green, look for improvement opportunities
/project-refine

# Or run both in sequence for a full review
/project-health --all
/project-refine
```

The refinement questions within each `project-health` category (e.g. "could `docs-sync` be improved?") are domain-specific — they belong in `project-health` because they're refinement considerations *about a specific correctness domain*. General improvement work (docs restructuring, code deduplication, test grouping, bloat reduction) belongs in `project-refine` because it cuts across domains and requires a different mindset.

**Shared infrastructure:** both skills use the same document scanning scope, CLAUDE.md configuration section, and project type awareness. Running one does not duplicate work done by the other.

---

## Invocation

```bash
# Interactive — presents menu of categories to select
/project-health

# Run specific categories
/project-health docs-sync cross-refs

# Run all categories for this project type
/project-health --all

# Run categories configured as default in CLAUDE.md
/project-health --defaults

# Predefined groups (see Suggested Invocation Groups)
/project-health --commit
/project-health --prerelease
/project-health --setup

# For improvement and bloat reduction, use the companion skill
/project-refine
```

---

## CLAUDE.md Configuration

Stored in `## Health Check Configuration`:

```markdown
## Health Check Configuration

**Default checks:** docs-sync, cross-refs, consistency, coverage, quality
**Skip:** git, effectiveness
**Performance budget:** 400 lines max per SKILL.md
**Additional doc paths:** wiki/, design/
```

If no section is present, built-in defaults are used.

---

## Document Scanning Scope

When running any check that involves reading documentation, build the scan list in this order:

### 1. Universal baseline (always included)

All `.md` files (recursive) in any folder named `doc/`, `docs/`, or `documentation/` (case-insensitive), plus any root-level `.md` file matching these well-known names (case-insensitive):

| Group | Filenames |
|-------|-----------|
| Entry points | `readme`, `overview`, `summary`, `index` |
| Process | `contributing`, `governance`, `code_of_conduct`, `support`, `maintainers` |
| Change tracking | `changelog`, `history`, `release`, `release-notes`, `release_notes` |
| Architecture & design | `architecture`, `design`, `decisions`, `vision`, `philosophy`, `principles` |
| Technical | `api`, `schema`, `glossary`, `security`, `deployment`, `install`, `installation`, `usage`, `troubleshooting` |
| Project management | `roadmap`, `thesis`, `spec`, `specification`, `requirements` |

Any root `.md` file not on this list is still scanned — the list simply guarantees they are never skipped.

### 2. Inline documentation (always included)

Some projects keep docs alongside their code. Always scan:
- Any `README.md` anywhere in the directory tree (per-module, per-package docs)
- Any `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` found anywhere in the tree
- For Java: `package-info.java` and Javadoc comments in source files

### 3. Per project type (included automatically)

| Type | Additional scan targets |
|------|------------------------|
| `skills` | All `SKILL.md` files in repo root subdirectories |
| `java` | `pom.xml` / `build.gradle`; Javadoc in `src/` |
| `blog` | `_config.yml`, `_posts/`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/` |
| `custom` | The Primary Document path declared in CLAUDE.md |

### 4. User-configured locations (from CLAUDE.md)

Declared in `## Health Check Configuration` as `Additional doc paths:` — useful for wiki directories, generated resource files, non-standard architecture folders, etc.

### 5. Non-markdown files (scanned where relevant)

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — skill registry and versions
- `hooks/` — hook scripts
- `scripts/` — what scripts actually do (for logic and docs-sync checks)
- `tests/` — what is tested (for coverage and code checks)

**Principle:** scan broadly rather than miss a stale reference. If a file is irrelevant, the check simply finds nothing of interest there.

---

## Category Overview

Each category covers two dimensions:
- **Quality** — is it correct, complete, and compliant? (pass/fail)
- **Refinement** — could it be clearer, smaller, or better structured? (judgment)

**Type key:** Mechanical — scriptable, low ambiguity · Judgment — Claude must reason about intent · Mixed — some of each

---

### Universal Checks

*Apply to every project type. Specific items within a category may vary by type — see per-type notes below.*

| Category | Quality focus | Refinement focus | Type | When to run |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|------|-------------|
| `docs-sync` | Code matches docs, no stale language, correct counts and URLs | Over-explanation, mismatched detail level, mergeable sections | Mechanical | Every commit, pre-release |
| `consistency` | No contradictions, no duplicate content, consistent terminology | Consolidation into single source of truth, terminology glossary | Judgment | Pre-release, deep review |
| `logic` | Workflows executable, UX unblocked, exit codes correct | Simplify steps, reduce confirmations, plain-language errors | Judgment | Pre-release, deep review |
| `config` | CLAUDE.md complete for project type, required sections present | CLAUDE.md overloaded, Sync Rules oversimplifiable | Mechanical | On setup, pre-release |
| `security` | No secrets, safe shell patterns, correct permissions | Simpler scripts reduce attack surface; shell vs Python tradeoffs | Mechanical | Pre-release |
| `release` | Versions consistent, labels set up, no SNAPSHOT for release | Release notes coherent, issue titles useful, versioning simplified | Mixed | Release only |
| `user-journey` | Onboarding works, errors recoverable, no dead ends | Automate setup steps, shorten onboarding, better prompt timing | Judgment | Pre-release, major changes |
| `git` | Clean state, no stale worktrees, tags match versions | Branching strategy, tag naming, dead branches | Mechanical | On demand |
| `primary-doc` | Project's designated primary document is accurate and current | Could it be better structured or modularised? | Mixed | Pre-release, deep review |
| `artifacts` | All required primary artifacts for this project type exist | Are any required artifacts over-complicated? | Mechanical | On setup, pre-release |
| `conventions` | Project conventions are documented in CLAUDE.md and followed | Could conventions be expressed more concisely? | Mixed | Pre-release |
| `framework` | Documented patterns and examples are correct for the project's framework | Could framework guidance be simplified? | Judgment | Pre-release, deep review |
| *(see project-refine)* | — | Docs structure, code deduplication, test grouping, universal bloat — handled by [`project-refine`](project-refine.md) | Judgment | On demand, periodic |

---

*Type-specific checks (java, blog, custom, skills) are documented in their respective skills — see [Routing](#routing) above.*

### Refinement Domains (within `refine`)

*The `refine` category is organised by domain rather than correctness — everything here is an improvement opportunity, not a failure.*

| Domain | What it looks for | Bloat score applies? |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| `docs` | Structure re-evaluation, modularisation, consolidation, readability, dead content | Yes |
| `code` | Repeated patterns, copy-paste with variation, missing abstractions, dead code | Yes |
| `tests` | Scattered coverage, repeated setup, file bloat, grouping inconsistency | Yes |
| `universal` | File budget overruns, deep nesting, over-engineering, excessive commentary | Yes — primary source of bloat score |

---

### Suggested Invocation Groups

| Group | Categories | Use when |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `--commit` | `docs-sync`, `cross-refs`*, `coverage`*, `naming`* | Fast checks after every significant change |
| `--prerelease` | All mechanical + mixed categories for the project type | Before tagging a release |
| `--deep` | All categories for the project type | Periodic deep review, after major refactors |
| `--setup` | `config`, `artifacts`, `infrastructure`*, `coverage`* | After initial project setup |

*\* type: skills only — skipped automatically for other project types*

For dedicated improvement sessions, use [`/project-refine`](project-refine.md).

## Check Categories

Each category below covers both **Quality** (is it correct?) and **Refinement** (could it be better?). Quality items are declarative pass/fail checks. Refinement items are judgment questions — there is no single right answer.

---

### `docs-sync` — Documentation Accuracy

**Quality** — Does documentation accurately reflect the current state of the code?
- [ ] Code behaviour matches what docs describe
- [ ] No "planned" / "not yet implemented" language for things that exist
- [ ] Skill counts and validator counts are correct everywhere
- [ ] Version numbers consistent (marketplace.json, plugin.json, docs)
- [ ] URLs and GitHub repo references are correct
- [ ] No stale "TODO" or "coming soon" references
- [ ] Release status language matches actual state

**Refinement** — Could the documentation communicate the same information more effectively?
- [ ] Are there over-explained sections where the code is self-evident?
- [ ] Is the detail level appropriate for the intended audience?
- [ ] Could any prose be replaced with a table or example that's easier to scan?
- [ ] Are there sections whose purpose overlaps enough to merge?

---

### `consistency` — Internal Consistency

**Quality** — Does everything agree with itself?
- [ ] No contradictions between any two documents on the same topic
- [ ] No duplicate information that could drift (same content in 2+ places)
- [ ] Section naming conventions followed (Skill Chaining, not Skill chaining)
- [ ] Common Pitfalls tables use consistent column format
- [ ] Severity levels (CRITICAL/WARNING/NOTE) used consistently
- [ ] Terminology is consistent (e.g. "invoke" not mixed with "call" or "use")

**Refinement** — Could duplicated or scattered information be consolidated?
- [ ] Could scattered terminology be unified in a glossary or shared reference?
- [ ] Are there sections that say the same thing in different words that should be merged?
- [ ] Could inconsistent formatting be standardised to reduce cognitive load?

---

### `logic` — Workflow Logic & UX

**Quality** — Do the described workflows actually work?
- [ ] No workflow step references a script or file that doesn't exist
- [ ] No workflow step requires an external tool (`gh`, `mvn`, etc.) without checking it's available
- [ ] Hook outputs are directive (ACTION REQUIRED) not just informational
- [ ] Hook doesn't fire on non-git directories
- [ ] No skill blocks progress without giving the user a way forward
- [ ] Error messages include recovery steps
- [ ] No redundant checks (same thing checked twice in the same flow)
- [ ] Skill chaining doesn't create infinite loops
- [ ] Exit codes in validators match what calling skills expect

**Refinement** — Could workflows be simpler or more intuitive?
- [ ] Are there steps that could be combined without losing clarity?
- [ ] Are any prompts or confirmations asked more times than necessary?
- [ ] Could any multi-step flow be reduced by inferring the answer from context?
- [ ] Are any error messages technical where plain language would serve the user better?

---

### `config` — Project Configuration Health

**Quality** — Is the project properly configured for its type?
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists and has `## Project Type`
- [ ] Project type is one of: skills, java, blog, custom, generic
- [ ] Required primary artifacts for the project type exist (see type-specific skills for details)
- [ ] `## Commit Messages` section present (no-AI-attribution rule)
- [ ] `## Work Tracking` present if team collaboration is needed (advisory)
- [ ] `## Document Structure` threshold configured if doc nudge is desired

**Refinement** — Is the configuration easy to understand and maintain?
- [ ] Is CLAUDE.md overloaded with sections that could be removed or consolidated?
- [ ] Are any sections so rarely changed they could be documented once and simplified?
- [ ] Could the Sync Rules table (for type: custom) be expressed more concisely?

---

### `security` — Security & Safety

**Quality** — Are there security or safety issues in scripts and hooks?
- [ ] No hardcoded tokens, passwords, or API keys in any file
- [ ] Shell scripts quote variables to prevent word splitting
- [ ] No `rm -rf` without explicit path validation
- [ ] No `eval` of untrusted input
- [ ] All executable scripts have correct permissions (executable for owner, not world-writable) — not just hooks
- [ ] No secrets in git history (check recent commits)
- [ ] Scripts validate inputs before acting on them

**Refinement** — Could scripts be made safer by being simpler?
- [ ] Are any scripts doing more than they need to (smaller attack surface = less code)?
- [ ] Could complex shell logic be replaced with Python that's easier to audit?
- [ ] Are permission checks and input validation in the most readable location?

---

### `release` — Release Readiness

**Quality** — Is the project ready for a versioned release?
- [ ] No version markers indicating work-in-progress (SNAPSHOT, dev, alpha) in release artifacts
- [ ] All component versions consistent and intentional
- [ ] GitHub labels set up for release note generation
- [ ] `gh release create --generate-notes` would produce meaningful output
- [ ] RELEASE.md reflects current versioning strategy
- [ ] No obviously incomplete skills (stubs, empty sections)
- [ ] All tests passing

**Refinement** — Would the release be meaningful and well-presented?
- [ ] Would the generated release notes tell a coherent story?
- [ ] Are the GitHub issue titles good enough to serve as changelog entries?
- [ ] Could the versioning strategy be simplified (e.g. fewer SNAPSHOT states)?

---

### `user-journey` — End User Experience

**Quality** — Would a first-time user have a coherent experience?
- [ ] Installation path is documented and works (`/plugin marketplace add` → `/install-skills`)
- [ ] First commit flow is guided (CLAUDE.md created, project type set)
- [ ] Session-start hook provides helpful prompt on first open
- [ ] `/issue-workflow` offer is clear and skippable
- [ ] Error messages explain what went wrong and how to recover
- [ ] No dead ends (every failure state has a next step)
- [ ] Slash commands autocomplete correctly (`/java-git-commit`, etc.)

**Refinement** — Could the experience be faster or less friction-heavy?
- [ ] Could any required setup step be inferred or automated rather than prompted?
- [ ] Is the onboarding sequence longer than it needs to be?
- [ ] Are any optional prompts surfaced too early in the flow?

---

### `git` — Repository State

**Quality** — Is the git repository in a healthy state?
- [ ] No uncommitted changes that should be committed
- [ ] No stale git worktrees
- [ ] Tags consistent with marketplace versions (for release)
- [ ] No merge conflict markers in tracked files
- [ ] Branch is up to date with remote

**Refinement** — Could the git workflow itself be simpler?
- [ ] Is the branching strategy more complex than the team size justifies?
- [ ] Could tag naming be more consistent or informative?
- [ ] Are there branches or worktrees that outlived their purpose?

---

### `primary-doc` — Primary Document Accuracy

Every project type has a designated primary document. This check verifies it is accurate and current regardless of what that document is.

**Quality** — Does the primary document accurately reflect the current state of the project?
- [ ] The primary document exists (type-specific — see augmentation table)
- [ ] Content accurately describes what the project currently does, not what was planned
- [ ] No sections describe features, architecture, or workflows that no longer exist
- [ ] Referenced files, paths, and modules within the document still exist
- [ ] Terminology matches what is actually used in the codebase

**Refinement** — Could the primary document be better structured or more useful?
- [ ] Is the document an appropriate size, or should it be split into focused modules?
- [ ] Are there sections so rarely updated they've become stale noise?
- [ ] Could the structure be reorganised to match how readers actually navigate it?
- [ ] Are there sections that duplicate information found in other documents?

*Type-specific augmentations: see per-type tables above.*

---

### `artifacts` — Required Artifacts Exist

Every project type has required primary artifacts. This check verifies they are all present without knowing in advance what they are — the project type determines the list.

**Quality** — Do all required primary artifacts for this project type exist?
- [ ] All required files and directories exist (type-specific — see augmentation table)
- [ ] Required configuration files are present and parseable
- [ ] Any artifact referenced in CLAUDE.md actually exists at the declared path
- [ ] No required artifact is empty, stubbed, or contains only placeholder content

**Refinement** — Are the required artifacts appropriate in scope?
- [ ] Is any required artifact significantly larger than it needs to be?
- [ ] Are there required artifacts that have become redundant and could be retired?
- [ ] Could any required artifacts be combined without losing their purpose?

*Type-specific augmentations: see per-type tables above.*

---

### `conventions` — Conventions Declared and Followed

Every project type has conventions — commit formats, file naming rules, coding standards. This check verifies they are documented and the project adheres to them.

**Quality** — Are project conventions documented and followed?
- [ ] Project-specific conventions are documented in CLAUDE.md (or a referenced doc)
- [ ] Commit messages follow the declared conventions for this project type
- [ ] File naming follows the declared conventions (type-specific — see augmentation table)
- [ ] No convention is documented but never followed, or followed but never documented
- [ ] Conventions referenced in skill/workflow documentation match what's actually enforced

**Refinement** — Could conventions be expressed more clearly or concisely?
- [ ] Are any conventions so obvious they don't need documentation?
- [ ] Are any conventions so complex they suggest the underlying approach should simplify?
- [ ] Could related conventions be grouped for easier reference?
- [ ] Are there conventions that conflict with each other subtly?

*Type-specific augmentations: see per-type tables above.*

---

### `framework` — Framework-Specific Pattern Correctness

Every project uses a framework with specific patterns. This check verifies that documented examples, code patterns, and workflow guidance are correct for the declared framework — not just generically correct.

**Quality** — Are documented patterns correct for this project's framework?
- [ ] Code examples in docs use patterns that are correct for the declared framework
- [ ] Documented workflows account for framework-specific constraints
- [ ] No guidance recommends an approach the framework explicitly discourages
- [ ] Framework-specific annotations, decorators, or conventions are used correctly in examples
- [ ] Patterns are current for the version of the framework in use

**Refinement** — Could framework guidance be more focused or easier to apply?
- [ ] Is framework-specific guidance scattered or consolidated where it's easy to find?
- [ ] Are there framework patterns documented that are never actually used in the project?
- [ ] Could framework guidance link to authoritative external docs rather than re-explaining concepts?

*Type-specific augmentations: see per-type tables above.*

---

## Output Format

Findings grouped by severity:

```
## project-health report — [categories run]

### CRITICAL (must fix)
- [docs-sync] docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md says blog-git-commit "not yet implemented" — it is
- [coverage] issue-workflow missing from README § Skill Chaining Reference

### HIGH (should fix)
- [cross-refs] git-commit description omits blog-git-commit routing

### MEDIUM (worth fixing)
- [naming] issue-workflow not in Workflow integrators section of CLAUDE.md

### LOW (nice to fix)
- [quality] issue-workflow SKILL.md is 287 lines — within budget but growing

### PASS
✅ consistency, security, infrastructure, release
```

For improvement opportunities and bloat scoring, see [`project-refine`](project-refine.md) — its output format uses 🔴🟡🟢 bloat scores rather than severity ratings.

---

## Commit-time Subset

Some checks are fast and important enough to run after every significant commit. The full set is TBD — marked here as a placeholder.

**Candidates:**
- `docs-sync` — "planned" language, wrong counts
- `cross-refs` — new chaining without bidirectional update
- `coverage` — new skill added but not integrated
- `naming` — skill name drift

**Not suitable for every commit:**
- `user-journey` — expensive
- `effectiveness` — subjective
- `git` — stateful
- `release` — milestone only

---

## Calling from Other Skills

When a skill needs a specific check, it references this skill rather than duplicating the check list:

```
After staging a new skill, run:
  python scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit

Or for a full integration check:
  /project-health coverage cross-refs naming
```

Skills that should reference project-health:
- `git-commit` — suggest `coverage` check when new SKILL.md staged
- Pre-commit checklist in CLAUDE.md — reference `project-health --defaults` before releases

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should checks be purely Claude-driven, or should more have Python validator scripts?
- [ ] Should `project-health` offer to auto-fix mechanical issues (counts, versions)?
- [ ] What is the commit-time subset? (TBD — see above)
- [ ] Should there be a `project-health --quick` that only runs the fastest checks?
- [ ] Should findings persist anywhere (a `.health-report.md`) or always ephemeral?
