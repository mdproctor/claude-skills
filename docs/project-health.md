# project-health — Design Document

**Status:** Design phase — not yet implemented as a skill
**Skill name (planned):** `project-health`
**Slash command (planned):** `/project-health`

This document tracks the design and scope of the `project-health` skill. It is a working document — update it as the skill evolves.

---

## Purpose

A single skill that covers all the systematic verification, validation, and improvement checks that get asked for repeatedly during development. Instead of asking Claude ad-hoc, the user invokes a named, configurable, consistent check.

It replaces:
- "do a deep analysis of our work"
- "make sure docs and code are in sync"
- "check for duplications, conflicts, gaps"
- "look for potential bugs or poor UX"
- pre-release system reviews

Other skills can reference specific check categories when they need things verified.

---

## Invocation

```bash
# Interactive — presents menu of categories to select
/project-health

# Run specific categories
/project-health docs-sync cross-refs

# Run all categories
/project-health --all

# Run categories configured as default in CLAUDE.md
/project-health --defaults
```

---

## CLAUDE.md Configuration

Stored in `## Health Check Configuration` section:

```markdown
## Health Check Configuration

**Default checks:** docs-sync, cross-refs, consistency, coverage, quality
**Skip:** git, effectiveness
**Performance budget:** 400 lines max per SKILL.md
```

If no section is present, a built-in default set is used.

---

## Document Scanning Scope

When running any check that involves reading documentation, build the scan list in this order:

### 1. Universal baseline (always included)
- All `.md` files (recursive) in any folder named **`doc/`, `docs/`, or `documentation/`** (case-insensitive)
- Any root-level `.md` file matching these well-known names (case-insensitive):

| Category | Files |
|----------|-------|
| Entry points | `readme`, `overview`, `summary`, `index` |
| Process | `contributing`, `governance`, `code_of_conduct`, `support`, `maintainers` |
| Change tracking | `changelog`, `history`, `release`, `release-notes`, `release_notes` |
| Architecture & design | `architecture`, `design`, `decisions`, `vision`, `philosophy`, `principles` |
| Technical | `api`, `schema`, `glossary`, `security`, `deployment`, `install`, `installation`, `usage`, `troubleshooting` |
| Project management | `roadmap`, `thesis`, `spec`, `specification`, `requirements` |

Any root `.md` file not on this list is still scanned — this list simply guarantees they are never skipped.

### 2. Inline documentation (always included)
Some projects keep docs alongside their code rather than in a central folder. Always scan:
- Any **`README.md`** anywhere in the directory tree (per-module, per-package docs)
- For Java: **`package-info.java`** and Javadoc comments in source files (for logic and docs-sync checks)
- Any **`CHANGELOG.md`**, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`** found anywhere in the tree

### 3. Per project type (included automatically)

| Type | Additional scan targets |
|------|------------------------|
| `skills` | All `SKILL.md` files in repo root subdirectories |
| `java` | `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` (dependency and version checks); Javadoc in `src/` |
| `blog` | `_config.yml`, `_posts/`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/` |
| `custom` | The Primary Document path declared in CLAUDE.md |

### 4. User-configured locations (from CLAUDE.md)
Projects can declare additional documentation locations in `## Health Check Configuration`:

```markdown
## Health Check Configuration

**Additional doc paths:** src/main/resources/META-INF/, wiki/, design/
```

These are scanned in addition to the baseline — useful for projects where docs live in non-standard locations (generated resource files, wiki directories, architecture folders, etc.).

### 5. Non-markdown files (scanned where relevant)
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — skill registry and versions
- `hooks/` — hook scripts
- `scripts/` — what scripts actually do (for logic and docs-sync checks)
- `tests/` — what is tested (for coverage and code checks)

**Principle:** scan broadly rather than miss a stale reference. If a file is irrelevant, the check simply finds nothing of interest there.

## Category Overview

**Type key:** Mechanical — scriptable, low ambiguity · Judgment — Claude must reason about intent or UX · Mixed — some of each

---

## Output Format

Findings grouped by severity, then by category:

```
## project-health report

### CRITICAL (must fix)
- [docs-sync] docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md says blog-git-commit is "not yet implemented" — it is
- [coverage] issue-workflow missing from README § Skill Chaining Reference

### HIGH (should fix)
- [cross-refs] git-commit description omits blog-git-commit routing

### MEDIUM (worth fixing)
- [naming] issue-workflow not in Workflow integrators section of CLAUDE.md

### LOW (nice to fix)
- [quality] issue-workflow SKILL.md is 287 lines — within budget but growing

### PASS (no issues)
✅ frontmatter, consistency, security, infrastructure, release
```

---

## Commit-time Subset (to define later)

Some checks are fast enough and important enough to run on every commit. This subset is TBD — marked here as a placeholder.

**Candidates for commit-time subset:**
- `coverage` — new skill added but not integrated
- `cross-refs` — new chaining without bidirectional update
- `naming` — skill name drift
- `docs-sync` — "planned" language, wrong counts

**Not suitable for every commit:**
- `user-journey` — expensive, judgment-heavy
- `effectiveness` — subjective
- `git` — stateful
- `release` — only relevant at milestone time

---

## Calling from Other Skills

When a skill needs a specific check, it references this skill rather than duplicating the check list:

```
After staging a new skill, run:
  python scripts/validate_all.py --tier commit

Or for a full integration check:
  /project-health coverage cross-refs naming
```

Skills that should reference project-health:
- `git-commit` — suggest `coverage` check when new SKILL.md staged
- Pre-commit checklist in CLAUDE.md — reference `project-health --defaults` before releases

---

### `refine` — Improvement Opportunities

> What could be made smaller, clearer, or better structured without changing what it does?

Unlike `quality` (which checks structural compliance) and `logic` (which checks correctness), `refine` looks at things that already work but could be refined. Every finding includes a **bloat score** and an **impact tier** to help prioritise.

---

#### Bloat Score

Each finding is rated on two axes:

**Size reduction potential:**
- 🔴 **HIGH** — could eliminate or reduce by >30% of lines/tokens/complexity
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — 10–30% reduction possible
- 🟢 **LOW** — minor, <10%, still worth noting

**Impact of fixing:**
- **A** — affects navigation, readability, or maintenance significantly
- **B** — noticeable improvement
- **C** — cosmetic or marginal

Combined rating examples: `🔴A` (large gain, high impact), `🟢C` (tiny, cosmetic).

---

#### Documentation — Structure & Organisation

- [ ] **Structure re-evaluation** — would a different grouping or ordering of sections/files improve navigation? Are related topics scattered across multiple docs that should be consolidated?
- [ ] **Modularisation opportunities** — docs over ~400 lines with multiple distinct topics that would be clearer as separate linked files
- [ ] **Consolidation opportunities** — multiple small files covering closely related topics that would read better merged
- [ ] **Readability** — passive voice, unexplained jargon, walls of text without examples or structure, sentences over 25 words, paragraphs that could be tables or bullet lists
- [ ] **Redundant preamble** — sections that restate what was just said, or introductory paragraphs that add no information
- [ ] **Dead documentation** — sections describing plans, history, or context that are no longer relevant and add noise

---

#### Code — Deduplication & Abstraction

- [ ] **Repeated patterns** — the same block of logic appearing 3+ times; high risk because fixes applied to one copy are often missed in others
- [ ] **Copy-paste with variation** — similar but not identical blocks; should be parameterised and shared
- [ ] **Methods/functions doing too much** — single functions over ~30 lines that combine multiple distinct concerns and would be clearer split
- [ ] **Hardcoded values repeated** — the same literal value (string, number, path) appearing in multiple places; should be a named constant
- [ ] **Missing abstractions** — repeated sequences of calls that always appear together and belong in a helper
- [ ] **Commented-out code** — dead code left in place; remove it (git history preserves it)

---

#### Tests — Grouping & Modularisation

- [ ] **Scattered tests for the same concern** — tests for one feature spread across multiple files without clear ownership
- [ ] **Repeated test setup** — the same fixture or arrangement code copy-pasted across multiple test methods; should be a shared helper or `setUp`
- [ ] **Test file bloat** — test files over ~300 lines that test multiple unrelated concerns and would be clearer split by concern
- [ ] **Naming inconsistency** — test names that don't follow a consistent pattern, making it hard to find what's covered
- [ ] **Missing grouping** — tests that would benefit from being grouped into test classes or modules to reflect the structure of what they're testing

---

#### Universal Bloat Check

Applies across docs, code, and tests:

- [ ] **Files significantly over budget** — any file >50% larger than the guideline for its type (SKILL.md: ~400 lines, test files: ~300 lines, source files: project-specific)
- [ ] **Deeply nested structures** — logic or document sections nested >3 levels deep that could be flattened
- [ ] **Long parameter lists** — functions with >4 parameters that could be grouped into a config object or simplified
- [ ] **Over-engineered solutions** — complex machinery for a problem that has a simpler solution (e.g. a validation framework for 3 rules)
- [ ] **Excessive commentary** — more comment lines than code lines explaining obvious things; good code with good names needs fewer comments

---

#### Output format for `refine`

Unlike other categories, `refine` presents findings as **opportunities** not failures:

```
## refine — Opportunities Found

### 🔴A — High impact, significant size reduction
- scripts/validate_all.py (lines 45–89): run_validator() logic repeated
  for each tier; extract to a shared helper. Est. -40 lines.

### 🟡B — Medium impact
- update-primary-doc/SKILL.md (312 lines): Steps 4–7 cover two unrelated
  concerns (discovery and validation); consider splitting into two sections
  with a shared intro. Est. -20 lines, clearer navigation.

### 🟢C — Low impact, cosmetic
- java-dev/SKILL.md: "Code duplication" and "Code clarity" sections could
  merge; they are adjacent and both cover style conventions.
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should checks be purely Claude-driven, or should more have Python validator scripts?
- [ ] Should `project-health` offer to auto-fix mechanical issues (counts, versions)?
- [ ] What is the commit-time subset? (TBD — see above)
- [ ] Should there be a `project-health --quick` that only runs the fastest checks?
- [ ] Should findings persist anywhere (a `.health-report.md` file) or always ephemeral?
