# Session Handoff — cc-praxis Health & Refine Trial

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Repository:** github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis
**Working directory:** /Users/mdproctor/claude/skills
**Previous session ID:** The long session that designed and implemented health/refine (session ending ~2026-04-02, working directory /Users/mdproctor/claude/skills)
**Head commit:** `1117346`

## What Was Completed This Session

All six health and refine skills have been **designed, implemented, and deployed**:

| Skill | Slash command | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| `project-health` | `/project-health` | ✅ Live |
| `project-refine` | `/project-refine` | ✅ Live |
| `skills-project-health` | `/skills-project-health` | ✅ Live |
| `java-project-health` | `/java-project-health` | ✅ Live |
| `blog-project-health` | `/blog-project-health` | ✅ Live |
| `custom-project-health` | `/custom-project-health` | ✅ Live |

All 28 skills are synced to `~/.claude/skills/` and will be available in the new session.

## What To Do in the New Session

**Trial the health and refine skills on this repository** (type: skills).

```bash
# Option 1 — universal entry point (auto-chains to skills-project-health)
/project-health

# Option 2 — direct type-specific entry (same result)
/skills-project-health

# Option 3 — improvement opportunities
/project-refine
```

When prompted for tier, start with **tier 2** (standard, ~5 min) to get a feel for the output. Use **tier 3** (`--prerelease`) for a full check before deciding on v1.0.

---

## Key Design Decisions to Know

**Tier system (both skills — prompt if omitted):**
- `--tier 1` / `--commit` — validators only (~30s)
- `--tier 2` / `--standard` — universal quality checks (~5 min)
- `--tier 3` / `--prerelease` — full universal + type-specific (~15 min)
- `--tier 4` / `--deep` — everything + refinement questions (~30 min)

**Routing:**
- `/project-health` detects `type: skills` from CLAUDE.md, runs universal checks, auto-chains to `skills-project-health` in the same session
- `/skills-project-health` runs universal checks first (as prerequisite), then skills-specific — identical output either way

**Output format:**
- Universal findings: no prefix (e.g. `- [docs-sync] ...`)
- Type-specific findings: `[skills]` prefix (e.g. `- [skills][coverage] ...`)
- Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / PASS

**project-refine tiers:**
- Tier 1: structural checks, no file reading (~2 min)
- Tier 2: reads top candidates by git churn + file size (~10 min)
- Tier 3: deeper scan, IntelliJ MCP if available (~20 min)
- Tier 4: full scope, prompts for focus area (~30-45 min)

**Saving reports:**
```bash
/project-health --tier 3 --save   # writes 2026-04-02-health-report.md
/project-refine --tier 2 --save   # writes 2026-04-02-refine-report.md
```

## After Trialling

Once you've run the skills and seen the output:

1. **Fix any CRITICAL findings** they surface
2. **Decide on v1.0 release** — the repository is feature-complete; health/refine implementation was the main remaining work
3. **Tag the release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0 -a -m "v1.0.0 — initial release"
   git push origin --tags
   gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes
   ```

---

## Repository State

- **28 skills** installed and synced in `~/.claude/skills/`
- **All tests passing:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
- **All validators passing:** `python3 scripts/validate_all.py`
- **Design docs** in `docs/`: `project-health.md`, `project-refine.md`, `java-project-health.md`, `blog-project-health.md`, `custom-project-health.md`, `skills-project-health.md`

## Files to Read First

1. `CLAUDE.md` — project conventions, no-AI-attribution rule, skill architecture
2. `docs/project-health.md` — full design spec for the health skill
3. `docs/session-handoff.md` — this file
