- ✅ **Quarkus/Vert.x specialized** (event loop, BOM, reactive patterns)
- ✅ **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR validated** (tested under pressure scenarios)

## Getting Started: Project Type Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Skills route differently based on project type. First-time commit in any repository will guide you through setup interactively, or you can set it up manually.

### The 4 Project Types

| Type | When to Use | Documentation | Commit Skill |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **skills** | Claude Code skill repositories (has `*/SKILL.md` files) | README.md + CLAUDE.md (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **java** | Java/Maven/Gradle projects | DESIGN.md (required) + CLAUDE.md (optional, auto-synced) | `java-git-commit` |
| **custom** | Working groups, research, docs, advocacy | User-configured primary document (auto-synced) | `custom-git-commit` |
| **generic** | Everything else | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**

Just try to commit. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing or has no project type, `git-commit` will ask you 4 questions and create it for you:

```bash
git add <your files>
# Then say "commit" to Claude - it will guide you through setup
```

**Option 2: Manual**

Create `CLAUDE.md` in your repository root:

**For Skills Repositories:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** skills
```

**For Java Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** java
```
Then create `docs/DESIGN.md` (java-git-commit will block without it).

**For Custom Projects** (working groups, research, docs, etc.):
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** custom
**Primary Document:** docs/vision.md

**Sync Strategy:** bidirectional-consistency

**Sync Rules:**
| Changed Files | Document Section | Update Type |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| catalog/*.md | Vision - Current Landscape | Add project summary |
| docs/meetings/*.md | Governance | Add meeting summary |

**Current Milestone:** Phase 1 - Discovery
```

**For Generic Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** generic
```

### What Happens at Commit Time

**type: skills** → `git-commit`:
- Validates SKILL.md files with `skill-review`
- Auto-syncs README.md (skill catalog)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: java** → `java-git-commit`:
- Requires docs/DESIGN.md (blocks if missing)
- Auto-syncs DESIGN.md (architecture)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)
- Java-specific commit scopes (`rest`, `repository`, `service`, etc.)

**type: custom** → `custom-git-commit`:
- Syncs user-configured primary document (VISION.md, THESIS.md, etc.)
- Follows user's Sync Rules table
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: generic** → `git-commit`:
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Basic conventional commits

### Why Explicit Type Declaration?

**We tried auto-detection.** It was fragile:
- Research repos with pom.xml files got treated as Java projects
- Java projects without pom.xml yet got treated as generic
- Renaming files broke detection mid-project

**Explicit declaration is better:**
- You know exactly what workflow you're getting
- Type won't change unexpectedly
- Easy to override if project evolves
- Clear error messages when using wrong skill

### Changing Project Types

Just edit CLAUDE.md and change the type. Example: research project graduates to production Java service:

```diff
## Project Type

-**Type:** custom
-**Primary Document:** THESIS.md
+**Type:** java
```

Remove custom-specific fields, create `docs/DESIGN.md`, and you're done.

## Why Commit Messages and Design Docs Actually Matter (Yes, Really)

Let's be honest: writing good commit messages and keeping design documentation in sync with code is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It ranks somewhere between "updating Jira tickets" and "mandatory corporate training videos" on the Developer Fun Scale™.

**The usual developer experience:**
- **3:00 PM:** Write brilliant code solving a complex problem
- **3:45 PM:** `git commit -m "fix stuff"` (you'll remember what it does, right?)
- **3:46 PM:** Move on to next task (design doc? what design doc?)
- **Next Tuesday:** Teammate asks "Why did we change the cache invalidation strategy?"
- **You:** *frantically scrolls through git log* "Uhh... 'fix stuff', 'more fixes', 'actually fix it this time'..."
- **3 months later:** You're debugging and find your own code. No idea why it works that way. Commit message: "refactor". Thanks, past you. Really helpful.

**The actual cost of bad commit messages:**
- **Debugging time:** 30 minutes trying to understand why code exists → discover commit message is "wip" → give up, rewrite it
- **Code review delays:** Reviewer has no context → asks 10 clarifying questions → you forgot what you did → meeting scheduled
- **Incident post-mortems:** "When did this bug get introduced?" → `git bisect` → 20 commits all say "updates" → cry
- **Onboarding new developers:** "Just read the git history to understand the architecture" → they quit

**The actual cost of stale design docs:**
- **Architecture drift:** DESIGN.md says system uses Redis → code actually uses Hazelcast (changed 8 months ago, doc never updated)
- **Wrong decisions:** New developer reads outdated doc → implements feature the wrong way → has to redo it
- **Meeting overhead:** Every design question becomes "let me check the code to see what we actually did"
- **Institutional knowledge loss:** Senior dev leaves → their mental model of the system dies with them

**The automation win:**

These skills make documentation *painless* by doing it *as you code*:
- `java-git-commit` generates proper conventional commit messages automatically by analyzing your actual changes
- `update-design` keeps DESIGN.md in sync with code *before* you commit, not as a quarterly exercise
- Both work together so documentation is *part of* the commit, not a separate chore you skip

**Result:** Six months from now, you'll thank yourself. Your teammates will thank you. The new hire will thank you. And that 2 AM production incident? The git history will actually help instead of making you want to rage-quit.

You're not writing documentation. You're leaving breadcrumbs for Future You, who has the memory of a goldfish and the patience of a caffeinated squirrel.

## Why Skills Even Exist

**The problem:** Without skills, every conversation with Claude starts from scratch:
- Claude: "Let me write this workflow with a `for` loop!"
- You: "No, use the FuncDSL. We talked about this yesterday."
- Claude: "Right! Let me mock the database."
- You: "No! Real database! We *just* discussed this!"
- Claude: "Got it! Should I use `HashMap`?"
- You: *flips desk*

**The solution:** Skills = "things we've already figured out, written down once, so we never have to explain them again." Think of them as the difference between training a golden retriever and training a goldfish.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills are designed to chain together for complete workflows:

### Development → Review → Commit (Java repositories)
```
java-dev or quarkus-flow-dev
  → quarkus-flow-testing (if writing tests)
  → java-code-review (automatic or manual)
    → java-git-commit
      → update-design + update-claude-md (automatic)
```

```
superpowers:writing-skills
  → skill-review (automatic when SKILL.md staged)
  → git-commit
    → update-claude-md + update-readme (automatic)
```

### Architecture Decision → Documentation
```

```
/java-git-commit
/java-code-review
/java-security-audit
/maven-dependency-update
/quarkus-observability
/update-design
/adr
```

Skills trigger automatically when relevant keywords appear in conversation or when working with specific file types.

## Contributing

These skills are tailored for specific project conventions. When adapting for your own use:

1. Review safety and concurrency rules in `java-dev`
2. Adjust conventional commit types in `java-git-commit`
3. Customize BOM versions in `maven-dependency-update`
4. Update observability endpoints in `quarkus-observability`
5. Extend generic principles skills for other languages/frameworks (e.g., `go-code-review`, `gradle-dependency-update`)

## Skill Quality & Validation

All skills have been systematically improved following the [superpowers:writing-skills](https://github.com/anthropics/superpowers) methodology:

- ✅ **CSO-optimized descriptions** (Claude Search Optimization) - trigger-focused, no workflow summaries
- ✅ **Token efficiency** - heavy reference material extracted to separate files
- ✅ **Quick Reference tables** - scannable summaries for fast lookup
- ✅ **Common Pitfalls tables** - documented mistakes with fixes (standardized 3-column format)
- ✅ **Real-World Impact** - production incidents demonstrating why rules matter
- ✅ **Decision flowcharts** - visual guides for non-obvious decisions (Graphviz-validated)
- ✅ **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR validation** - java-dev tested under pressure scenarios

**Testing methodology:** Skills are validated by running baseline scenarios WITHOUT the skill (documenting agent behavior), then WITH the skill (verifying compliance). The java-dev skill successfully prevented resource leaks under combined time pressure, authority pressure, and sunk cost.

**Recent quality improvements (2026-03):**
- ✅ **Logic correctness audit:** Fixed 15 logic errors (4 CRITICAL, 7 MAJOR, 4 MINOR) including invalid Maven commands, missing flowchart paths, broken cross-references, and command correctness issues
- ✅ **Security audit:** Comprehensive OWASP Top 10 review completed — 9.2/10 security posture, zero vulnerabilities detected, excellent safety controls throughout
- ✅ **Readability enhancements:** Applied 4 systematic patterns across 14 skills — standardized table formatting, added section transitions, made decision points explicit, added visual separators for improved scannability
- ✅ **Cross-reference integrity:** All skill chaining verified bidirectionally, Prerequisites sections accurate, flowcharts validated with `dot`
- ✅ **Consistency enforcement:** All skills follow conventions (naming patterns, section ordering, Common Pitfalls format, Success Criteria for artifact-producing skills)
