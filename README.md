# cc-praxis

**Claude Code skills that make professional software development feel automatic.**

You commit code — it reviews for safety issues first, syncs your design document, links the GitHub issue, and writes the conventional commit message. You ask Claude to implement a feature — it designs a spec, gets your approval, then writes a TDD implementation plan. You end a session — it captures a handover so the next session picks up in one message.

48 skills for Java/Quarkus, TypeScript/Node.js, and Python. Install the ones relevant to your stack, in any order.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis
/plugin install install-skills
/install-skills
```

Pick a language bundle (or start with just 3 skills — see [Getting Started Guide](https://mdproctor.github.io/cc-praxis/guide/)). Close the session. Skills are active in every session after.

> **New to cc-praxis?** The [Getting Started Guide](https://mdproctor.github.io/cc-praxis/guide/) walks you through the full workflow in 12 steps — pick Java, TypeScript, or Python.

> **Dependency resolution note:** The official Claude Code marketplace doesn't yet support automatic dependency resolution ([Issue #9444](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9444)). The `/install-skills` wizard handles this for you. If you prefer installing manually, use the `scripts/claude-skill` installer below.

**To uninstall:**
```bash
/uninstall-skills
```

---

### Web UI — `scripts/web_installer.py`

If you have the repository cloned locally, the web installer gives you a visual browser for managing skills:

```bash
python3 scripts/web_installer.py          # opens http://localhost:8765 automatically
python3 scripts/web_installer.py --port 8766 --no-browser
```

Or after the plugin is installed: just run `cc-praxis` in your terminal.

---

### Manual Installer — `scripts/claude-skill`

Clone the repository and use the bundled installer directly. This gives you automatic dependency resolution without the wizard, plus the full local development workflow described in [Contributing & Local Development](#contributing--local-development).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis.git ~/cc-praxis
cd ~/cc-praxis
```

```bash
# Install individual skills (auto-resolves dependencies)
scripts/claude-skill install java-dev
scripts/claude-skill install quarkus-flow-testing   # installs java-dev + quarkus-flow-dev automatically

# Install all skills
scripts/claude-skill install-all -y

# List what's installed
scripts/claude-skill list

# Uninstall
scripts/claude-skill uninstall java-dev
scripts/claude-skill uninstall-all -y
```

**Installed skills location:** `~/.claude/skills/`

## Overview

Each skill encodes battle-tested best practices, common pitfalls, and project-specific conventions so Claude Code gives consistent, production-ready guidance without re-explaining the same things every session. See [Key Features](#key-features-what-makes-these-skills-different) for a full breakdown.

## Getting Started: Project Type Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Skills route differently based on project type. First-time commit in any repository will guide you through setup interactively, or you can set it up manually.

### Project Types

| Type | When to Use | Documentation | Commit Skill |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **skills** | Claude Code skill repositories (has `*/SKILL.md` files) | README.md + CLAUDE.md (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **java** | Java/Maven/Gradle projects | DESIGN.md (required) + CLAUDE.md (optional, auto-synced) | `java-git-commit` |
| **blog** | GitHub Pages / Jekyll blogs (date-prefixed posts) | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **custom** | Working groups, research, docs, advocacy | User-configured primary document (auto-synced) | `custom-git-commit` |
| **generic** | Everything else | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |

📖 **[Complete Project Type Documentation: docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md)** — Detailed taxonomy, routing logic, decision matrix, and examples for all project types. See [docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md) for why explicit declaration is used over auto-detection.

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**

Just try to commit. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing or has no project type, `git-commit` will prompt you to choose one and create it for you:

```bash
git add <your files>
# Then say "commit" to Claude - it will guide you through setup
```

**Option 2: Manual**

Add to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** java   # java | skills | blog | custom | generic
```

For the `custom` type's full sync configuration and all type definitions: [docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md).

### What Happens at Commit Time

**type: skills** → `git-commit`:
- Validates SKILL.md files (follows skill-validation.md workflow)
- Auto-syncs README.md (skill catalog)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: java** → `java-git-commit`:
- Requires docs/DESIGN.md (blocks if missing)
- Auto-syncs DESIGN.md (architecture)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)
- Java-specific commit scopes (`rest`, `repository`, `service`, etc.)

**type: blog** → `git-commit`:
- Blog-aware commit scopes (`post`, `layout`, `config`, `asset`)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Post filename validation (`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format enforced)
- Commit type validation (`post`, `edit`, `draft`, `asset`, `config` only)
- 72-char subject limit (not 50 — blog titles are longer than code commit subjects)

**type: custom** → `custom-git-commit`:
- Syncs user-configured primary document (VISION.md, THESIS.md, etc.)
- Follows user's Sync Rules table
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: generic** → `git-commit`:
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Basic conventional commits

## Why This Collection Exists

Three problems that compound silently:

**Commits without context:** "fix stuff" at 3pm is obvious. By Tuesday it's archaeology. Structured commit messages (`fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition`) make git history searchable and release notes automatic.

**Design docs that drift:** Code evolves; DESIGN.md doesn't get updated. Three months later, the doc describes a system that no longer exists. Automated sync keeps docs honest.

**Repeated explanations:** Every new session, every new collaborator needs the same context. Skills encode that context once. The right workflow runs automatically.


## Skills

48 skills across three language stacks. [**Browse the full skill catalog →**](docs/skills-catalog.md)

Quick-start bundles — each gives immediate value with 3 skills:

| Bundle | Skills |
|--------|--------|
| **Quick Start: Java / Quarkus** | `java-dev` + `java-code-review` + `java-git-commit` |
| **Quick Start: TypeScript** | `ts-dev` + `ts-code-review` + `git-commit` |
| **Quick Start: Python** | `python-dev` + `python-code-review` + `git-commit` |

Install with `/install-skills` and pick a quick-start bundle. Full language bundles (Java: 10 skills, TypeScript: 5, Python: 5) are also available.

## Contributing & Local Development

### Releasing Skills

Skills use trunk-based development with git tags. See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the full release workflow, versioning conventions, and how marketplace.json versioning relates to per-skill plugin.json versions.

---

### Session-Start Hook

`hooks/check_project_setup.sh` runs at every Claude Code session start. It checks whether the current directory has a `CLAUDE.md` with a project type declared, and if not, outputs an `⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED` directive prompting Claude to ask you to set one up.

`scripts/claude-skill sync-local` automatically keeps your local copy of this hook in sync with the repo version and ensures it's registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

### Skill Authoring Environment

When you clone this repository, `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically by Claude Code, giving you expert in-context guidance on:
- Skill architecture and frontmatter requirements
- Claude Search Optimization (CSO) — how descriptions determine when skills trigger
- Naming conventions (`java-*`, `*-principles`, framework prefixes)
- Skill chaining patterns and bidirectional cross-references
- Quality assurance workflows and pre-commit checklists
- Document sync and validation

This makes the cloned repository a **complete skill development environment**. See [CLAUDE.md § Skill Architecture](CLAUDE.md#skill-architecture) for the full authoring guide and [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) for the validation framework.

---

### Local Development Workflow

The recommended workflow copies your local edits directly into Claude Code's plugin cache, so changes are live in the next session you open.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis.git ~/cc-praxis
cd ~/cc-praxis

# Install all skills from local source into Claude Code's cache
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y
```

**After editing a skill:**
```bash
vim java-dev/SKILL.md

# Push the change into Claude Code's cache
scripts/claude-skill sync-local -y
```

**After a `git pull`:**
```bash
git pull
scripts/claude-skill sync-local -y   # update cache with latest
```

### `sync-local` Reference

```bash
# Update already-installed skills from local source
scripts/claude-skill sync-local

# Also install skills not yet in the cache (default: update only)
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all

# Skip confirmation prompt
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y
```

`sync-local` writes to Claude Code's plugin cache (`~/.claude/skills/`) and updates the registry files. It never modifies the source files or git history.

---

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run just the installer tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_claude_skill.py -v
```

Tests use temporary directories throughout and never touch your real install location.

---

### Running Validators

```bash
# Full validation suite (commit tier — fast, <2s)
python3 scripts/validate_all.py

# Specific validators
python3 scripts/validation/validate_frontmatter.py   # YAML structure
python3 scripts/validation/validate_cso.py           # Skill descriptions
python3 scripts/validation/validate_project_types.py # Project type list consistency

# Validate a specific document
python3 scripts/validate_document.py README.md
```

See [QUALITY.md § Validation Script Roadmap](QUALITY.md#validation-script-roadmap) for the full list of validators and their tier assignments.

---

### Adapting Skills for Your Own Use

These skills encode conventions from specific projects. When customising:

1. Review safety and concurrency rules in `java-dev` — inspired by Sanne Grinovero's Java guidelines
2. Adjust conventional commit types in `java-git-commit`
3. Customise BOM versions in `maven-dependency-update`
4. Update observability endpoints in `quarkus-observability`
5. Extend the generic principles skills for other languages/frameworks (e.g., `go-code-review`, `gradle-dependency-update`) — see [CLAUDE.md § Extending to New Languages](CLAUDE.md#extending-to-new-languages-pattern-examples)

## Quality & Validation Framework

For contributors and skill authors: [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) covers the full validation framework — 19 validators across commit/push/CI tiers, the division of labour between scripts and Claude, and the skill authoring quality bar.
