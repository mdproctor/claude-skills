# Claude Code Skills for Java & Quarkus Development

A curated collection of specialized skills for Claude Code that streamline Java development, focusing on Quarkus applications, quarkus-flow workflows, and professional software engineering practices.

## Overview

These skills transform Claude Code into an expert Java/Quarkus development assistant that understands enterprise-grade code quality, safety requirements, and modern cloud-native patterns. Each skill encodes best practices, common pitfalls, and project-specific conventions to ensure consistent, production-ready code.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Quick Reference tables** for instant lookup
- ✅ **Red Flags sections** to prevent rationalizations
- ✅ **Common Mistakes tables** documenting pitfalls
- ✅ **Real-World Impact** sections with production incidents
- ✅ **Decision flowcharts** for complex workflows
- ✅ **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR validated** (tested with pressure scenarios)

## Why Commit Messages and Design Docs Actually Matter (Yes, Really)

Let's be honest: writing good commit messages and keeping design documentation in sync with code is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It ranks somewhere between "updating Jira tickets" and "mandatory corporate training videos" on the Developer Fun Scale™.

**The usual developer experience:**
- **3:00 PM:** Write brilliant code solving a complex problem
- **3:45 PM:** `git commit -m "fix stuff"` (you'll remember what it does, right?)
- **3:46 PM:** Move on to next task (design doc? what design doc?)
- **Next Tuesday:** Teammate asks "Why did we change the cache invalidation strategy?"
- **You:** *frantically scrolls through git log* "Uhh... 'fix stuff', 'more fixes', 'actually fix it this time'..."
- **3 months later:** You're debugging and find your own code. No idea why it works that way. Commit message: "refactor". Thanks, past you. Really helpful.

**The actual cost of bad commit messages:**
- **Debugging time:** 30 minutes trying to understand why code exists → discover commit message is "wip" → give up, rewrite it
- **Code review delays:** Reviewer has no context → asks 10 clarifying questions → you forgot what you did → meeting scheduled
- **Incident post-mortems:** "When did this bug get introduced?" → `git bisect` → 20 commits all say "updates" → cry
- **Onboarding new developers:** "Just read the git history to understand the architecture" → they quit

**The actual cost of stale design docs:**
- **Architecture drift:** DESIGN.md says system uses Redis → code actually uses Hazelcast (changed 8 months ago, doc never updated)
- **Wrong decisions:** New developer reads outdated doc → implements feature the wrong way → has to redo it
- **Meeting overhead:** Every design question becomes "let me check the code to see what we actually did"
- **Institutional knowledge loss:** Senior dev leaves → their mental model of the system dies with them

**The automation win:**

These skills make documentation *painless* by doing it *as you code*:
- `java-git-commit` generates proper conventional commit messages automatically by analyzing your actual changes
- `update-design` keeps DESIGN.md in sync with code *before* you commit, not as a quarterly exercise
- Both work together so documentation is *part of* the commit, not a separate chore you skip

**Result:** Six months from now, you'll thank yourself. Your teammates will thank you. The new hire will thank you. And that 2 AM production incident? The git history will actually help instead of making you want to rage-quit.

You're not writing documentation. You're leaving breadcrumbs for Future You, who has the memory of a goldfish and the patience of a caffeinated squirrel.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills are designed to chain together for complete workflows:

### Development → Review → Commit
```
java-dev or quarkus-flow-dev
  → quarkus-flow-testing (if writing tests)
  → code-review (automatic or manual)
    → java-git-commit
      → update-design (automatic)
```

### Architecture Decision → Documentation
```
Major decision made
  → adr (capture decision)
    → update-design (sync with DESIGN.md)
      → java-git-commit
```

### Dependency Management → Commit
```
dependency-update
  → code-review (if code changes)

## Contributing

These skills are tailored for specific project conventions. When adapting for your own use:

1. Review safety and concurrency rules in `java-dev`
2. Adjust conventional commit types in `java-git-commit`
3. Customize BOM versions in `dependency-update`
4. Update observability endpoints in `logging-observability`

## Skill Quality & Validation

All skills have been systematically improved following the [superpowers:writing-skills](https://github.com/anthropics/superpowers) methodology:

- ✅ **CSO-optimized descriptions** (Claude Search Optimization) - trigger-focused, no workflow summaries
- ✅ **Token efficiency** - heavy reference material extracted to separate files
- ✅ **Quick Reference tables** - scannable summaries for fast lookup
- ✅ **Common Mistakes tables** - documented pitfalls with fixes
- ✅ **Real-World Impact** - production incidents demonstrating why rules matter
- ✅ **Decision flowcharts** - visual guides for non-obvious decisions
- ✅ **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR validation** - java-dev tested under pressure scenarios

**Testing methodology:** Skills are validated by running baseline scenarios WITHOUT the skill (documenting agent behavior), then WITH the skill (verifying compliance). The java-dev skill successfully prevented resource leaks under combined time pressure, authority pressure, and sunk cost.
