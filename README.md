- ✅ **Multi-layered quality assurance** (automated validation, pre-commit gates, document corruption prevention)

## Getting Started: Project Type Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Skills route differently based on project type. First-time commit in any repository will guide you through setup interactively, or you can set it up manually.

### The 4 Project Types

| Type | When to Use | Documentation | Commit Skill |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **skills** | Claude Code skill repositories (has `*/SKILL.md` files) | README.md + CLAUDE.md (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **java** | Java/Maven/Gradle projects | DESIGN.md (required) + CLAUDE.md (optional, auto-synced) | `java-git-commit` |
| **custom** | Working groups, research, docs, advocacy | User-configured primary document (auto-synced) | `custom-git-commit` |
| **generic** | Everything else | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**

Just try to commit. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing or has no project type, `git-commit` will ask you 4 questions and create it for you:

```bash
git add <your files>
# Then say "commit" to Claude - it will guide you through setup
```

**Option 2: Manual**

Create `CLAUDE.md` in your repository root:

**For Skills Repositories:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** skills
```

**For Java Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** java
```
Then create `docs/DESIGN.md` (java-git-commit will block without it).

**For Custom Projects** (working groups, research, docs, etc.):
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** custom
**Primary Document:** docs/vision.md

**Sync Strategy:** bidirectional-consistency

**Sync Rules:**
| Changed Files | Document Section | Update Type |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| catalog/*.md | Vision - Current Landscape | Add project summary |
| docs/meetings/*.md | Governance | Add meeting summary |

**Current Milestone:** Phase 1 - Discovery
```

**For Generic Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** generic
```

### What Happens at Commit Time

**type: skills** → `git-commit`:
- Validates SKILL.md files with `skill-review`
- Auto-syncs README.md (skill catalog)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: java** → `java-git-commit`:
- Requires docs/DESIGN.md (blocks if missing)
- Auto-syncs DESIGN.md (architecture)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)
- Java-specific commit scopes (`rest`, `repository`, `service`, etc.)

**type: custom** → `custom-git-commit`:
- Syncs user-configured primary document (VISION.md, THESIS.md, etc.)
- Follows user's Sync Rules table
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: generic** → `git-commit`:
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Basic conventional commits

### Why Explicit Type Declaration?

**We tried auto-detection.** It was fragile:
- Research repos with pom.xml files got treated as Java projects
- Java projects without pom.xml yet got treated as generic
- Renaming files broke detection mid-project

**Explicit declaration is better:**
- You know exactly what workflow you're getting
- Type won't change unexpectedly
- Easy to override if project evolves
- Clear error messages when using wrong skill

### Changing Project Types

Just edit CLAUDE.md and change the type. Example: research project graduates to production Java service:

```diff
## Project Type

-**Type:** custom
-**Primary Document:** THESIS.md
+**Type:** java
```

Remove custom-specific fields, create `docs/DESIGN.md`, and you're done.

## Why Commit Messages and Design Docs Actually Matter (Yes, Really)

Let's be honest: writing good commit messages and keeping design documentation in sync with code is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It ranks somewhere between "updating Jira tickets" and "mandatory corporate training videos" on the Developer Fun Scale™.

**The usual developer experience:**
- **3:00 PM:** Write brilliant code solving a complex problem
- **3:45 PM:** `git commit -m "fix stuff"` (you'll remember what it does, right?)
- **3:46 PM:** Move on to next task (design doc? what design doc?)
- **Next Tuesday:** Teammate asks "Why did we change the cache invalidation strategy?"
- **You:** *frantically scrolls through git log* "Uhh... 'fix stuff', 'more fixes', 'actually fix it this time'..."
- **3 months later:** You're debugging and find your own code. No idea why it works that way. Commit message: "refactor". Thanks, past you. Really helpful.

**The actual cost of bad commit messages:**
- **Debugging time:** 30 minutes trying to understand why code exists → discover commit message is "wip" → give up, rewrite it
- **Code review delays:** Reviewer has no context → asks 10 clarifying questions → you forgot what you did → meeting scheduled
- **Incident post-mortems:** "When did this bug get introduced?" → `git bisect` → 20 commits all say "updates" → cry
- **Onboarding new developers:** "Just read the git history to understand the architecture" → they quit

**The actual cost of stale design docs:**
- **Architecture drift:** DESIGN.md says system uses Redis → code actually uses Hazelcast (changed 8 months ago, doc never updated)
- **Wrong decisions:** New developer reads outdated doc → implements feature the wrong way → has to redo it
- **Meeting overhead:** Every design question becomes "let me check the code to see what we actually did"
- **Institutional knowledge loss:** Senior dev leaves → their mental model of the system dies with them

**The automation win:**

These skills make documentation *painless* by doing it *as you code*:
- `java-git-commit` generates proper conventional commit messages automatically by analyzing your actual changes
- `java-update-design` keeps DESIGN.md in sync with code *before* you commit, not as a quarterly exercise
- Both work together so documentation is *part of* the commit, not a separate chore you skip

**Result:** Six months from now, you'll thank yourself. Your teammates will thank you. The new hire will thank you. And that 2 AM production incident? The git history will actually help instead of making you want to rage-quit.

You're not writing documentation. You're leaving breadcrumbs for Future You, who has the memory of a goldfish and the patience of a caffeinated squirrel.

## Why Skills Even Exist

**The problem:** Without skills, every conversation with Claude starts from scratch:
- Claude: "Let me write this workflow with a `for` loop!"
- You: "No, use the FuncDSL. We talked about this yesterday."
- Claude: "Right! Let me mock the database."
- You: "No! Real database! We *just* discussed this!"
- Claude: "Got it! Should I use `HashMap`?"
- You: *flips desk*

**The solution:** Skills = "things we've already figured out, written down once, so we never have to explain them again." Think of them as the difference between training a golden retriever and training a goldfish.

## Modular Documentation

**Split large documentation into focused modules while keeping everything automatically synchronized.**

### What Is Modular Documentation?

Instead of maintaining a single 2000-line document, split it into focused files:

**Before:**
```
docs/DESIGN.md (2000 lines)
  - Overview, Architecture, Components, API, Data Model, Deployment...
```

**After:**
```
docs/DESIGN.md (200 lines - navigation)
docs/design/architecture.md
docs/design/components.md
docs/design/api.md
docs/design/data-model.md
docs/design/deployment.md
```

**The sync workflows automatically discover all modules, update them together, and validate cross-file integrity.**

### Why Use Modular Documentation?

**Large single-file documents become unmaintainable:**
- Hard to navigate (find specific section in 2000 lines)
- Different concerns mixed together (architecture + API + deployment)
- Merge conflicts when multiple people edit
- Cognitive overload when updating one part

**Modular structure solves this:**
- Each file focused on one concern (easier to understand, edit, review)
- Parallel editing (no merge conflicts between architecture and API changes)
- Better navigation (jump directly to `api.md` instead of scrolling)
- **Automatic synchronization** - sync workflows keep all files in sync

### Hybrid Discovery Approach

**Automatic discovery (preferred):**

Sync workflows discover modules through multiple methods:

**1. Markdown links:**
```markdown
See [Architecture](docs/design/architecture.md) for component structure.
```

**2. Include directives:**
```markdown
<!-- include: components.md -->
```

**3. Section references:**
```markdown
§ API Details in docs/design/api.md
```

**4. Directory patterns:**
If your primary file is `DESIGN.md`, sync automatically checks `docs/design/*.md`

**Caching for performance:**
- First sync: Discovers structure, caches in `.doc-cache.json` (gitignored)
- Subsequent syncs: Uses cache (<10ms, no re-parsing)
- Automatic cache invalidation when you add/remove links

### How Link Detection Works

**When you create a link in your primary document, sync workflows automatically:**

1. **Parse the link:** Extract file path from `[text](path.md)` or `§ Section in path.md`
2. **Resolve path:** Make it absolute relative to primary document
3. **Verify existence:** Check if the file actually exists
4. **Add to group:** Include in the document group for synchronized updates
5. **Cache structure:** Save for fast subsequent syncs

**This happens automatically. You just add links, sync workflows handle the rest.**

### Navigating Modular Documents

**Primary file becomes navigation hub:**

```markdown
# Project Design

## Overview
High-level project summary...

## Architecture
See [Architecture](docs/design/architecture.md) for detailed component
structure, data flow, and design decisions.

## API
See [API Endpoints](docs/design/api.md) for REST endpoint documentation,
request/response schemas, and authentication.

## Data Model
See [Data Model](docs/design/data-model.md) for entity relationships,
database schema, and migration strategy.
```

**Module files contain focused content:**

```markdown
# Architecture

## Component Overview
[Detailed architecture content here...]

## Data Flow
[Sequence diagrams, data flow descriptions...]

## Design Decisions
[Rationale for architectural choices...]
```

**Cross-references between modules:**

```markdown
# API Endpoints

## Authentication
See [Security Model](security.md) for authentication flows.

## User API
Interacts with [User Service](../design/components.md#user-service).
```

### When to Modularize

**Use modular when:**
- Document exceeds ~500 lines
- Multiple distinct topics (architecture, API, data model, deployment)
- Multiple contributors editing different sections
- Frequent updates to specific sections

**Keep single-file when:**
- Document under ~300 lines
- Single cohesive topic
- Infrequent updates
- Solo maintainer

### Automatic Synchronization

**When you commit changes, sync workflows:**

1. **Discover modules** from your primary document (via links/includes/refs)
2. **Analyze code changes** and map to sections across all files
3. **Propose updates** grouped by file:
   ```
   ## Proposed DESIGN.md updates
   [changes to primary]

   ## Proposed docs/design/api.md updates
   [changes to API module]
   ```
4. **Wait for your YES** before applying anything
5. **Update all files together** (atomic operation)
6. **Validate entire group** (link integrity, completeness, no corruption)
7. **Revert ALL files** if validation fails (not just primary)

**You see all proposed changes before they're applied. You approve once, all files update together.**

### Universal Application

**Works across all project types:**

| Project Type | Documents | Example Modules |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Java projects** | DESIGN.md, CLAUDE.md | `docs/design/architecture.md`, `docs/workflows/build.md` |
| **Skills repositories** | README.md, CLAUDE.md | `docs/readme/skills.md`, `docs/workflows/ci.md` |
| **Research projects** | THESIS.md | `docs/thesis/methodology.md`, `docs/thesis/results.md` |
| **Working groups** | VISION.md | `docs/vision/projects.md`, `docs/vision/roadmap.md` |
| **API documentation** | API.md | `docs/api/endpoints.md`, `docs/api/schemas.md` |

Same discovery mechanism, same validation, same sync behavior - universal.

### Backwards Compatible

**No migration required.** Single-file documents work unchanged:

- Sync workflows discover zero modules → work as before
- No performance penalty (empty modules list is fast)
- Opt-in by adding links when you're ready

**Gradual migration:**

```
Week 1: Extract API section → docs/design/api.md, add link
Week 2: Extract data model → docs/design/data-model.md, add link
Week 3: Extract architecture → docs/design/architecture.md, add link
```

Each step is independently useful. No "all or nothing" migration.

### Example: Modularizing DESIGN.md

**Step 1: Create module file**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/design
# Move API section content to docs/design/api.md
```

**Step 2: Add link in DESIGN.md**
```markdown
## API
See [API Endpoints](docs/design/api.md) for REST endpoint documentation.
```

**Step 3: Commit**
```bash
git add DESIGN.md docs/design/api.md
git commit -m "docs(design): modularize API section"
```

**That's it.** Next time sync runs:
- Discovers `docs/design/api.md` via link
- Caches structure
- Updates both files when API-related code changes
- Validates links between them

### Quality Assurance

**Automatic validation prevents corruption:**

- ✅ **Link integrity:** Broken links block commit
- ✅ **Completeness:** Warns about orphaned modules
- ✅ **No duplication:** Detects duplicate content across files
- ✅ **Document structure:** Validates each file individually

**See QUALITY.md for complete validation framework.**

## Usage

### For Java Development

**When writing code:**
```
You: "I need to add pagination to the REST endpoint"
Claude: [Uses java-dev] Creates paginated endpoint with proper resource handling
```

**When committing:**
```
You: "commit"
Claude: [Uses java-git-commit]
  → Runs java-code-review (if not done)
  → Generates conventional commit message
  → Updates DESIGN.md via java-update-design
  → Updates CLAUDE.md via update-claude-md
  → Commits all changes together
```

### For Skills Development

**When creating a skill:**
```
You: "I want to create a Python development skill"
Claude: [Uses superpowers:writing-skills] Drafts skill with proper structure
```

**When committing:**
```
You: "commit"
Claude: [Uses git-commit]
  → Validates SKILL.md via skill-review
  → Generates conventional commit message
  → Updates README.md via readme-sync.md
  → Updates CLAUDE.md via update-claude-md
  → Commits all changes together
```

---

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** (CLI, Desktop, Web, or IDE extension)
- **For Java skills:** JDK 17+, Maven or Gradle
- **For commit skills:** Git configured with user name/email
- **For DESIGN.md sync:** docs/DESIGN.md must exist (java-git-commit will block without it)

## Contributing

These skills are tailored for specific project conventions. When adapting for your own use:

1. Review safety and concurrency rules in `java-dev`
2. Adjust conventional commit types in `java-git-commit`
3. Customize BOM versions in `maven-dependency-update`
4. Update observability endpoints in `quarkus-observability`
5. Extend generic principles skills for other languages/frameworks (e.g., `go-code-review`, `gradle-dependency-update`)

## Quality & Validation Framework

📖 **[Full Documentation: QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md)** — Comprehensive guide to validation tiers, division of labor between scripts and Claude, and implementation details.

**Every project using these skills gets comprehensive quality protection.** This multi-layered framework ensures reliability, consistency, and correctness across all 4 project types — not just for the skills repository itself, but for **your Java projects, custom documentation, and generic repositories**.

### Quick Reference: Running Validation

**Validate specific documents:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_document.py README.md
python scripts/validate_document.py docs/DESIGN.md
python scripts/validate_document.py docs/vision.md
```

**For skills repository:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_all.py                    # All skills
python scripts/validation/validate_cso.py         # CSO compliance
python scripts/validation/validate_flowcharts.py  # Graphviz syntax
```

**Automatic validation:** Pre-commit gates block CRITICAL issues. Post-sync validation auto-reverts corruption. See [QUALITY.md § When Validation Runs](QUALITY.md#when-validation-runs).

### Quality Protection by Project Type

| Project Type | Universal Protection | Type-Specific Protection |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **java** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | Code review, security audit, DESIGN.md sync, BOM alignment |
| **custom** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | Primary doc sync, user-configured validation, sync rules |
| **skills** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | SKILL.md validation, CSO compliance, README sync |
| **generic** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | (universal only) |

See [QUALITY.md § Quality Protection by Project Type](QUALITY.md#quality-protection-by-project-type) for detailed before/after comparisons.

### Validation Tiers

| Level | When | Time Budget | Key Checks |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Quick** | File save | <100ms | Syntax, heading hierarchy |
| **Commit** | Pre-commit | <2s | Structure, corruption (blocks CRITICAL) |
| **Review** | User-invoked | User-driven | Scripts + Claude deep analysis |
| **Push** | Pre-push | <30s | Cross-document consistency |
| **Full** | CI/Scheduled | <5min | Everything + external URLs |

See [QUALITY.md § Tiered Validation](QUALITY.md#tiered-validation) for complete details.

### Why This Framework Matters

Quality issues in AI-guided development compound exponentially. This framework prevents:
- **Code issues:** Resource leaks, concurrency bugs, security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation drift:** DESIGN.md, VISION.md, THESIS.md become lies
- **Corruption:** Duplicate headers, broken tables slip into git history
- **Expensive wallpaper:** Skills with bad descriptions get ignored by Claude

**Result:** Production-grade quality by default. The java-dev skill was pressure-tested and successfully prevented resource leaks that baseline Claude introduced. This framework ensures that reliability across all project types.

See [QUALITY.md § Why Quality Matters](QUALITY.md#why-quality-matters) for complete before/after comparisons and real incident examples.
