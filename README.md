# cc-praxis

A curated collection of Claude Code skills for professional software development — with deep Java/Quarkus support and universal principles that apply to any project.

## Installation

### Quick Start — Claude Code Marketplace

```bash
# Add this marketplace to Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis

# Run the one-time bootstrap wizard
/plugin install install-skills
/install-skills
```

The `/install-skills` wizard:
- Configures a session-start hook for automatic CLAUDE.md detection
- Lets you choose what to install (all skills, Java/Quarkus bundle, foundation principles, or individual)
- Automatically resolves and installs dependencies
- Verifies the setup

After the wizard completes, **close that conversation** — skills are then available in all future sessions.

> **Dependency resolution note:** The official Claude Code marketplace doesn't yet support automatic dependency resolution ([Issue #9444](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9444)). The `/install-skills` wizard handles this for you. If you prefer installing manually, use the `scripts/claude-skill` installer below.

**To uninstall:**
```bash
/uninstall-skills
```

The wizard checks for reverse dependencies and confirms before removing anything.

---

### Manual Installer — `scripts/claude-skill`

Clone the repository and use the bundled installer directly. This gives you automatic dependency resolution without the wizard, plus the full local development workflow described in [Contributing & Local Development](#contributing--local-development).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis.git ~/cc-praxis
cd ~/cc-praxis
```

```bash
# Install individual skills (auto-resolves dependencies)
scripts/claude-skill install java-dev
scripts/claude-skill install quarkus-flow-testing   # installs java-dev + quarkus-flow-dev automatically

# Install all skills
scripts/claude-skill install-all -y

# List what's installed
scripts/claude-skill list

# Uninstall
scripts/claude-skill uninstall java-dev
scripts/claude-skill uninstall-all -y
```

**Installed skills location:** `~/.claude/skills/`

## Overview

Each skill encodes battle-tested best practices, common pitfalls, and project-specific conventions so Claude Code gives consistent, production-ready guidance without re-explaining the same things every session. See [Key Features](#key-features-what-makes-these-skills-different) for a full breakdown.

## Getting Started: Project Type Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Skills route differently based on project type. First-time commit in any repository will guide you through setup interactively, or you can set it up manually.

### Project Types

| Type | When to Use | Documentation | Commit Skill |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **skills** | Claude Code skill repositories (has `*/SKILL.md` files) | README.md + CLAUDE.md (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **java** | Java/Maven/Gradle projects | DESIGN.md (required) + CLAUDE.md (optional, auto-synced) | `java-git-commit` |
| **blog** | GitHub Pages / Jekyll blogs (date-prefixed posts) | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |
| **custom** | Working groups, research, docs, advocacy | User-configured primary document (auto-synced) | `custom-git-commit` |
| **generic** | Everything else | CLAUDE.md optional (auto-synced) | `git-commit` |

📖 **[Complete Project Type Documentation: docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md)** — Detailed taxonomy, routing logic, decision matrix, and examples for all project types. See [docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md](docs/PROJECT-TYPES.md) for why explicit declaration is used over auto-detection.

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**

Just try to commit. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing or has no project type, `git-commit` will prompt you to choose one and create it for you:

```bash
git add <your files>
# Then say "commit" to Claude - it will guide you through setup
```

**Option 2: Manual**

Create `CLAUDE.md` in your repository root:

**For Skills Repositories:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** skills
```

**For Java Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** java
```
Then create `docs/DESIGN.md` (java-git-commit will block without it).

**For Custom Projects** (working groups, research, docs, etc.):
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** custom
**Primary Document:** docs/vision.md

**Sync Strategy:** bidirectional-consistency

**Sync Rules:**
| Changed Files | Document Section | Update Type |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| catalog/*.md | Vision - Current Landscape | Add project summary |
| docs/meetings/*.md | Governance | Add meeting summary |

**Current Milestone:** Phase 1 - Discovery
```

**For Blog Projects** (GitHub Pages / Jekyll):
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** blog
```

**For Generic Projects:**
```markdown
## Project Type

**Type:** generic
```

### What Happens at Commit Time

**type: skills** → `git-commit`:
- Validates SKILL.md files (follows skill-validation.md workflow)
- Auto-syncs README.md (skill catalog)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: java** → `java-git-commit`:
- Requires docs/DESIGN.md (blocks if missing)
- Auto-syncs DESIGN.md (architecture)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)
- Java-specific commit scopes (`rest`, `repository`, `service`, etc.)

**type: blog** → `git-commit`:
- Blog-aware commit scopes (`post`, `layout`, `config`, `asset`)
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Post filename validation (`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format enforced)
- Commit type validation (`post`, `edit`, `draft`, `asset`, `config` only)
- 72-char subject limit (not 50 — blog titles are longer than code commit subjects)

**type: custom** → `custom-git-commit`:
- Syncs user-configured primary document (VISION.md, THESIS.md, etc.)
- Follows user's Sync Rules table
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md (workflow conventions)

**type: generic** → `git-commit`:
- Auto-syncs CLAUDE.md if it exists
- Basic conventional commits

## Why This Collection Exists

Three problems that compound silently:

**Commits without context:** "fix stuff" at 3pm is obvious. By Tuesday it's archaeology. Structured commit messages (`fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition`) make git history searchable and release notes automatic.

**Design docs that drift:** Code evolves; DESIGN.md doesn't get updated. Three months later, the doc describes a system that no longer exists. Automated sync keeps docs honest.

**Repeated explanations:** Every new session, every new collaborator needs the same context. Skills encode that context once. The right workflow runs automatically.

## Skills Architecture

This collection follows a **layered architecture** where foundation skills provide universal principles, and specialized skills extend them for specific languages, frameworks, and workflows.

**Triggers:** "commit" in repositories with `type: java` declared in CLAUDE.md, or explicitly via "smart commit", "update design and commit", `/java-git-commit`.

#### **blog-git-commit**
Conventional commit workflow for GitHub Pages / Jekyll blogs:
- **Blog-specific content types** — `post` (new post), `edit` (update), `draft` (WIP), `asset` (images/CSS), `config` (site config)
- **Post filename validation** — enforces `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format before committing
- **72-char subject limit** — blog titles are longer than code commit subjects
- **Commit message validation** via `scripts/validation/validate_blog_commit.py`

**Triggers:** "commit" in repositories with `type: blog` declared in CLAUDE.md, or explicitly via `/blog-git-commit`.

#### **custom-git-commit**
Intelligent commit workflow for custom project types (working groups, research, documentation, advocacy):
- **User-configured primary document sync** — reads sync strategy from CLAUDE.md
- Flexible sync via Sync Rules table (file patterns → document sections)
- Supports bidirectional-consistency, research-progress, api-spec-sync, architectural-changes strategies

**Features:** Decision flowchart · Common Pitfalls table · examples for 4 project archetypes

**Triggers:** "commit" in repositories with `type: custom` declared in CLAUDE.md.

### Layer 2: Documentation Sync

#### **update-claude-md**
Maintains CLAUDE.md in sync with workflow and convention changes: build commands, testing patterns, naming conventions, repository-specific tools, and skill lists.

**Features:** Common Pitfalls table · starter templates for skills and code repositories

Invoked automatically by all commit skills (if CLAUDE.md exists), or independently. For architectural documentation see `java-update-design`.

**Triggers:** CLAUDE.md needs updating, or automatically via `git-commit`.

#### **java-update-design**

- Component structure and responsibilities
- Architectural patterns
- Integration points
- Technical decisions

**Features:**
- Common Pitfalls table (9 documentation mistakes)
- Java-specific signal detection (annotations → architectural meaning)

Invoked automatically by `java-git-commit` or independently. Handles architectural documentation; for workflow/convention documentation, see `update-claude-md`.

#### **readme-sync.md**
Maintains README.md documentation in sync with skill collection changes in skills repositories:
- Skill descriptions (Skills section)
- Chaining relationships (Skill Chaining Reference table)
- Feature additions (Key Features section)
- Repository structure changes

**Features:**
- Common Pitfalls table (8 documentation mistakes)
- Skills repository awareness (skill naming, chaining patterns)

Invoked automatically by `git-commit` (if README.md exists and skill changes detected), or independently. Specific to skills repositories; for code repositories, use project-specific documentation tools.

#### **update-primary-doc**

**Features:** Common Pitfalls table · sync strategy and pattern matching reference in separate files

Invoked automatically by `custom-git-commit` when Sync Rules configured.

**Triggers:** Primary document needs sync, or automatically via `custom-git-commit`.

### Layer 3: Review

#### **SKILL.md Validation (Modular Workflow)**

**Note:** SKILL.md validation for type: skills repositories is handled by the **skill-validation.md workflow**, not a portable skill. This modular documentation file is automatically referenced by git-commit when SKILL.md files are staged.

**What it validates:**
- Frontmatter structure (name, description, CSO compliance)
- Flowchart syntax (Mermaid validation, PUSH tier)
- Naming conventions (generic `-principles`, language prefixes)
- Cross-reference integrity (bidirectional chaining)
- Documentation completeness (Success Criteria, Common Pitfalls, Prerequisites)

**Automated validators:** `scripts/validate_all.py` orchestrates 14 validators across 3 tiers (commit/push/ci). See CLAUDE.md § Quality Assurance Framework for complete validation architecture.

**Why modular, not a skill:** Skills-specific validation only applies to THIS repository (type: skills). Loading as a portable skill would waste ~800 lines of tokens in all other projects (java, custom, generic). See CLAUDE.md § Skills-Repository-Specific Documentation. <!-- nocheck:project-types -->

## How Skills Work Together

Skills are designed to chain together for complete workflows:

### Development → Review → Commit (Java repositories)
```
java-dev or quarkus-flow-dev
  → quarkus-flow-testing (if writing tests)
  → java-code-review (automatic or manual)
    → java-git-commit
      → java-update-design + update-claude-md (automatic)
```

### Skill Development → Review → Commit (Skills repositories)
```
superpowers:writing-skills
  → git-commit
    → Validates SKILL.md (follows skill-validation.md workflow if staged)
    → update-claude-md + readme-sync.md (automatic)
```

### Blog Post → Commit (Blog repositories)
```
Write or edit a post
  → git-commit (or /blog-git-commit)
    → blog-git-commit (validates filename, type, message format)

```

### Architecture Decision → Documentation
```
Major decision made
  → adr (document decision)
  → git-commit
    → update-claude-md (automatic, adds ADR to "Key Decisions" section)
```

### Dependency Update → Review → Documentation
```
maven-dependency-update
  → java-code-review (if code compatibility changes)
  → adr (if significant version jump or new extension)
  → java-git-commit
    → java-update-design (documents new dependency architecture)
```

### Observability Setup → Dependencies → Commit
```
quarkus-observability
  → maven-dependency-update (adds OpenTelemetry/Micrometer extensions)
  → adr (documents observability strategy)
  → java-git-commit
    → java-update-design (documents monitoring architecture)
```

## Modular Documentation

**Split large documentation into focused modules while keeping everything automatically synchronized.**

### What Is Modular Documentation?

Instead of maintaining a single 2000-line document, split it into focused files:

**Before:**
```
docs/DESIGN.md (2000 lines)
  - Overview, Architecture, Components, API, Data Model, Deployment...
```

**After:**
```
docs/DESIGN.md (200 lines - navigation)
docs/design/architecture.md
docs/design/components.md
docs/design/api.md
docs/design/data-model.md
docs/design/deployment.md
```

**The sync workflows automatically discover all modules, update them together, and validate cross-file integrity.**

### Why Use Modular Documentation?

**Large single-file documents become unmaintainable:**
- Hard to navigate (find specific section in 2000 lines)
- Different concerns mixed together (architecture + API + deployment)
- Merge conflicts when multiple people edit
- Cognitive overload when updating one part

**Modular structure solves this:**
- Each file focused on one concern (easier to understand, edit, review)
- Parallel editing (no merge conflicts between architecture and API changes)
- Better navigation (jump directly to `api.md` instead of scrolling)
- **Automatic synchronization** - sync workflows keep all files in sync

### Hybrid Discovery Approach

**Automatic discovery (preferred):**

Sync workflows discover modules through multiple methods:

**1. Markdown links:**
```markdown
See [Architecture](docs/design/architecture.md) for component structure.
```

**2. Include directives:**
```markdown
<!-- include: components.md -->
```

**3. Section references:**
```markdown
§ API Details in docs/design/api.md
```

**4. Directory patterns:**
If your primary file is `DESIGN.md`, sync automatically checks `docs/design/*.md`

**Caching for performance:**
- First sync: Discovers structure, caches in `.doc-cache.json` (gitignored)
- Subsequent syncs: Uses cache (<10ms, no re-parsing)
- Automatic cache invalidation when you add/remove links

### How Link Detection Works

**When you create a link in your primary document, sync workflows automatically:**

1. **Parse the link:** Extract file path from `[text](path.md)` or `§ Section in path.md`
2. **Resolve path:** Make it absolute relative to primary document
3. **Verify existence:** Check if the file actually exists
4. **Add to group:** Include in the document group for synchronized updates
5. **Cache structure:** Save for fast subsequent syncs

**This happens automatically. You just add links, sync workflows handle the rest.**

### Navigating Modular Documents

**Primary file becomes navigation hub:**

```markdown
# Project Design

## Overview
High-level project summary...

## Architecture
See [Architecture](docs/design/architecture.md) for detailed component
structure, data flow, and design decisions.

## API
See [API Endpoints](docs/design/api.md) for REST endpoint documentation,
request/response schemas, and authentication.

## Data Model
See [Data Model](docs/design/data-model.md) for entity relationships,
database schema, and migration strategy.
```

**Module files contain focused content:**

```markdown
# Architecture

## Component Overview
[Detailed architecture content here...]

## Data Flow
[Sequence diagrams, data flow descriptions...]

## Design Decisions
[Rationale for architectural choices...]
```

**Cross-references between modules:**

```markdown
# API Endpoints

## Authentication
See [Security Model](security.md) for authentication flows.

## User API
Interacts with [User Service](../design/components.md#user-service).
```

### When to Modularize

**Use modular when:**
- Document exceeds ~500 lines
- Multiple distinct topics (architecture, API, data model, deployment)
- Multiple contributors editing different sections
- Frequent updates to specific sections

**Keep single-file when:**
- Document under ~300 lines
- Single cohesive topic
- Infrequent updates
- Solo maintainer

### Automatic Synchronization

**When you commit changes, sync workflows:**

1. **Discover modules** from your primary document (via links/includes/refs)
2. **Analyze code changes** and map to sections across all files
3. **Propose updates** grouped by file:
   ```
   ## Proposed DESIGN.md updates
   [changes to primary]

   ## Proposed docs/design/api.md updates
   [changes to API module]
   ```
4. **Wait for your YES** before applying anything
5. **Update all files together** (atomic operation)
6. **Validate entire group** (link integrity, completeness, no corruption)
7. **Revert ALL files** if validation fails (not just primary)

**You see all proposed changes before they're applied. You approve once, all files update together.**

### Universal Application

**Works across all project types:**

| Project Type | Documents | Example Modules |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Java projects** | DESIGN.md, CLAUDE.md | `docs/design/architecture.md`, `docs/workflows/build.md` |
| **Skills repositories** | README.md, CLAUDE.md | `docs/readme/skills.md`, `docs/workflows/ci.md` |
| **Research projects** | THESIS.md | `docs/thesis/methodology.md`, `docs/thesis/results.md` |
| **Working groups** | VISION.md | `docs/vision/projects.md`, `docs/vision/roadmap.md` |
| **API documentation** | API.md | `docs/api/endpoints.md`, `docs/api/schemas.md` |

Same discovery mechanism, same validation, same sync behavior - universal.

### Backwards Compatible

**No migration required.** Single-file documents work unchanged:

- Sync workflows discover zero modules → work as before
- No performance penalty (empty modules list is fast)
- Opt-in by adding links when you're ready

**Gradual migration:**

```
Week 1: Extract API section → docs/design/api.md, add link
Week 2: Extract data model → docs/design/data-model.md, add link
Week 3: Extract architecture → docs/design/architecture.md, add link
```

Each step is independently useful. No "all or nothing" migration.

### Example: Modularizing DESIGN.md

**Step 1: Create module file**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/design
# Move API section content to docs/design/api.md
```

**Step 2: Add link in DESIGN.md**
```markdown
## API
See [API Endpoints](docs/design/api.md) for REST endpoint documentation.
```

**Step 3: Commit**
```bash
git add DESIGN.md docs/design/api.md
git commit -m "docs(design): modularize API section"
```

**That's it.** Next time sync runs:
- Discovers `docs/design/api.md` via link
- Caches structure
- Updates both files when API-related code changes
- Validates links between them

### Quality Assurance

**Automatic validation prevents corruption:**

- ✅ **Link integrity:** Broken links block commit
- ✅ **Completeness:** Warns about orphaned modules
- ✅ **No duplication:** Detects duplicate content across files
- ✅ **Document structure:** Validates each file individually

**See QUALITY.md for complete validation framework.**

## Usage

### For Java Development

**When writing code:**
```
You: "I need to add pagination to the REST endpoint"
Claude: [Uses java-dev] Creates paginated endpoint with proper resource handling
```

**When committing:**
```
You: "commit"
Claude: [Uses java-git-commit]
  → Runs java-code-review (if not done)
  → Generates conventional commit message
  → Updates DESIGN.md via java-update-design
  → Updates CLAUDE.md via update-claude-md
  → Commits all changes together
```

### For Skills Development

**When creating a skill:**
```
You: "I want to create a Python development skill"
Claude: [Uses superpowers:writing-skills] Drafts skill with proper structure
```

**When committing:**
```
You: "commit"
Claude: [Uses git-commit]
  → Validates SKILL.md (follows skill-validation.md workflow)
  → Generates conventional commit message
  → Updates README.md via readme-sync.md
  → Updates CLAUDE.md via update-claude-md
  → Commits all changes together
```

---

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** (CLI, Desktop, Web, or IDE extension)
- **For Java skills:** JDK 17+, Maven or Gradle
- **For commit skills:** Git configured with user name/email
- **For DESIGN.md sync:** docs/DESIGN.md must exist (java-git-commit will block without it)

---

## Contributing & Local Development

### Releasing Skills

Skills use trunk-based development with git tags. See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the full release workflow, versioning conventions, and how marketplace.json versioning relates to per-skill plugin.json versions.

---

### Session-Start Hook

`hooks/check_project_setup.sh` runs at every Claude Code session start. It checks whether the current directory has a `CLAUDE.md` with a project type declared, and if not, outputs an `⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED` directive prompting Claude to ask you to set one up.

`scripts/claude-skill sync-local` automatically keeps your local copy of this hook in sync with the repo version and ensures it's registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

### Skill Authoring Environment

When you clone this repository, `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically by Claude Code, giving you expert in-context guidance on:
- Skill architecture and frontmatter requirements
- Claude Search Optimization (CSO) — how descriptions determine when skills trigger
- Naming conventions (`java-*`, `*-principles`, framework prefixes)
- Skill chaining patterns and bidirectional cross-references
- Quality assurance workflows and pre-commit checklists
- Document sync and validation

This makes the cloned repository a **complete skill development environment**. See [CLAUDE.md § Skill Architecture](CLAUDE.md#skill-architecture) for the full authoring guide and [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md) for the validation framework.

---

### Local Development Workflow

The recommended workflow copies your local edits directly into Claude Code's plugin cache, so changes are live in the next session you open.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdproctor/cc-praxis.git ~/cc-praxis
cd ~/cc-praxis

# Install all skills from local source into Claude Code's cache
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y
```

**After editing a skill:**
```bash
vim java-dev/SKILL.md

# Push the change into Claude Code's cache
scripts/claude-skill sync-local -y
```

**After a `git pull`:**
```bash
git pull
scripts/claude-skill sync-local -y   # update cache with latest
```

### `sync-local` Reference

```bash
# Update already-installed skills from local source
scripts/claude-skill sync-local

# Also install skills not yet in the cache (default: update only)
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all

# Skip confirmation prompt
scripts/claude-skill sync-local --all -y
```

`sync-local` writes to Claude Code's plugin cache (`~/.claude/skills/`) and updates the registry files. It never modifies the source files or git history.

---

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run just the installer tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_claude_skill.py -v
```

Tests use temporary directories throughout and never touch your real install location.

---

### Running Validators

```bash
# Full validation suite (commit tier — fast, <2s)
python3 scripts/validate_all.py

# Specific validators
python3 scripts/validation/validate_frontmatter.py   # YAML structure
python3 scripts/validation/validate_cso.py           # Skill descriptions
python3 scripts/validation/validate_project_types.py # Project type list consistency

# Validate a specific document
python3 scripts/validate_document.py README.md
```

See [QUALITY.md § Validation Script Roadmap](QUALITY.md#validation-script-roadmap) for the full list of validators and their tier assignments.

---

### Adapting Skills for Your Own Use

These skills encode conventions from specific projects. When customising:

1. Review safety and concurrency rules in `java-dev` — inspired by Sanne Grinovero's Java guidelines
2. Adjust conventional commit types in `java-git-commit`
3. Customise BOM versions in `maven-dependency-update`
4. Update observability endpoints in `quarkus-observability`
5. Extend the generic principles skills for other languages/frameworks (e.g., `go-code-review`, `gradle-dependency-update`) — see [CLAUDE.md § Extending to New Languages](CLAUDE.md#extending-to-new-languages-pattern-examples)

## Quality & Validation Framework

📖 **[Full Documentation: QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md)** — Comprehensive guide to validation tiers, division of labor between scripts and Claude, and implementation details.

**Every project using these skills gets comprehensive quality protection.** This multi-layered framework ensures reliability, consistency, and correctness across all project types — not just for the skills repository itself, but for **your Java projects, blogs, custom documentation, and generic repositories**.

### Quick Reference: Running Validation

**Validate specific documents:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_document.py README.md
python scripts/validate_document.py docs/DESIGN.md
python scripts/validate_document.py docs/vision.md
```

**For skills repository:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_all.py                    # All skills
python scripts/validation/validate_cso.py         # CSO compliance
python scripts/validation/validate_flowcharts.py  # Mermaid syntax (PUSH tier)
```

**Automatic validation:** Pre-commit gates block CRITICAL issues. Post-sync validation auto-reverts corruption. See [QUALITY.md § When Validation Runs](QUALITY.md#when-validation-runs).

### Quality Protection by Project Type

| Project Type | Universal Protection | Type-Specific Protection |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **java** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | Code review, security audit, DESIGN.md sync, BOM alignment |
| **blog** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | Blog-aware commit scopes (post/layout/config/asset) |
| **custom** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | Primary doc sync, user-configured validation, sync rules |
| **skills** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | SKILL.md validation, CSO compliance, README sync |
| **generic** | Document corruption, CLAUDE.md sync | (universal only) |

See [QUALITY.md § Quality Protection by Project Type](QUALITY.md#quality-protection-by-project-type) for detailed before/after comparisons.

### Validation Tiers

| Level | When | Time Budget | Key Checks |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Quick** | File save | <100ms | Syntax, heading hierarchy |
| **Commit** | Pre-commit | <2s | Structure, corruption (blocks CRITICAL) |
| **Review** | User-invoked | User-driven | Scripts + Claude deep analysis |
| **Push** | Pre-push | <30s | Cross-document consistency |
| **Full** | CI/Scheduled | <5min | Everything + external URLs |

See [QUALITY.md § Tiered Validation](QUALITY.md#tiered-validation) for complete details.

### Why This Framework Matters

Quality issues in AI-guided development compound exponentially. This framework prevents:
- **Code issues:** Resource leaks, concurrency bugs, security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation drift:** DESIGN.md, VISION.md, THESIS.md become lies
- **Corruption:** Duplicate headers, broken tables slip into git history
- **Expensive wallpaper:** Skills with bad descriptions get ignored by Claude

**Result:** Production-grade quality by default. The java-dev skill was pressure-tested and successfully prevented resource leaks that baseline Claude introduced. This framework ensures that reliability across all project types.

See [QUALITY.md § Why Quality Matters](QUALITY.md#why-quality-matters) for complete before/after comparisons and real incident examples.
