# Blog Writing — Mandatory Rules

These rules apply to every blog entry regardless of author, project, or voice.
They are not style preferences — they are craft constraints that cannot be
overridden by a personal style guide or invocation-time instructions.

## AI Collaboration Voice

### Three registers, used deliberately

**"I"** — for what the author thought, decided, believed, or wanted. Solo perspective only.
> "I expected the PTY work to be the difficult part."

**"we"** — for what the author and Claude built, tried, found, or fixed together.
> "We worked out why together: the PTY line discipline was echoing every byte..."

**"Claude"** (named directly) — when Claude's specific behaviour is worth narrating
in its own right: catching a mistake, reporting a result, going off-spec, flagging
a concern, pushing back, or getting something wrong.
> "Claude came back from manual testing with a one-liner: 'Text appears twice.'"
> "Claude didn't ask about it; it just noted the issue in its report."

### Introduce Claude before using "we"

"We" implies a named collaborator. A reader who hasn't been told Claude is involved
doesn't know who "we" refers to. Claude must appear — by name, in any register —
before "we" can be used.

**Don't — "we" before Claude has been mentioned:**
> "We built both. App 1 got asset scanning."

**Do — introduce Claude first:**
> "I brought Claude in to help with the wiring. We hit the same problem twice before realising it was a config issue."

**Do — name Claude directly first, then "we" flows naturally:**
> "Claude had wired the routes before I noticed the mismatch. We ended up reverting both."

### Vary "we" — avoid repetitive use

Repeated "we" across consecutive sentences reads as a tic. Mix in alternatives:

| Instead of another "we" | Try |
|--------------------------|-----|
| "We also found..." | "Claude and I also found..." |
| "We decided to..." | "Between us, we decided..." / "The decision was to..." |
| "We fixed it by..." | "The fix was..." |
| "We noticed that..." | "Claude flagged that..." / "I noticed that..." |

**Don't:**
> "We built the API layer. We then tested it. We found a bug. We fixed it."

**Do:**
> "We built the API layer. Testing revealed a bug — Claude flagged it during the first run. The fix was a simple backoff."

### When NOT to name Claude

Don't name Claude for routine execution — "Claude implemented PosixLibrary",
"Claude added the endpoint". Use "we" or just describe the outcome. Name Claude
only when its behaviour has character — catching, reporting, going off-script,
pushing back, or getting something wrong.

### Common register mistakes

**"we" as editorial device** — "we'll see why this matters later" — not collaboration,
it's an authorial tic. Change to "I'll return to this" or remove.

**"we" for team or community conventions** — "in Drools, we follow this pattern",
"for this project, we use alpha naming" — if this was a solo design decision or
a convention you followed alone, it's "I chose", not "we". "We" means the author
and Claude did this together.

**"we" for solo design decisions** — if the decision was the author's alone, it's "I",
not "we". The work may have been joint; the decision was singular.

**Third-person protagonist** — "the developer found", "the user believed" — always
becomes "I" or "we". There is no third-person narrator.

### Multiple Claude instances

When different Claude sessions contributed different things, name them distinctly:
> "Three separate Claude instances had each been asked to design the concept. I reviewed all three and synthesised them."
> "A separate Claude audited everything for consistency. It came back with five gaps."

Different sessions are different agents. Don't conflate them into one "Claude".

## Code Blocks

Two valid reasons to include a code snippet:

1. **The code IS the explanation** — the reader can't understand the point without
   seeing it. Always include a sentence explaining what it demonstrates.

2. **The code shows off the real thing** — seeing the actual API, DSL, or pattern
   gives readers a feel for the texture of the work. Use when the code is genuinely
   interesting — an elegant interface, a surprising pattern, something that makes the
   reader think "oh, that's how it looks." Not for boilerplate or trivial setup.

**The flavour test:** would a practitioner seeing this code think "that's worth showing"
or "that's just noise"? If the former, include it. If the latter, leave it out.

**Size limit:** if a snippet is more than ~15–20 lines, it's too long to read
comfortably in a blog. Either trim to the essential lines (use `// ...` to elide
uninteresting parts), or link to the full source and quote only the interesting section.

**Don't include:** boring setup, trivial getters/setters, standard library calls with
no interesting twist, anything easily reconstructed from the description, complete
file/class dumps.

## Images

Images do for a post what code snippets do — they make abstract things concrete and give a post texture that pure prose can't. Apply the same judgment: include when genuinely useful, not to pad.

**Three reasons to include an image:**

1. **UI work → always screenshot** — when the entry is about building or changing a UI, generate a mock screenshot or capture a PNG of the actual interface and include it. Seeing the thing being discussed is worth more than any description of it.

2. **Generated images** — consider whether a diagram, mockup, or generated visual would illustrate something better than prose or code. Architecture decisions, data flows, before/after states — these often benefit from a visual.

3. **Web search** — consider searching for images that make the content more interesting or easier to understand: explanatory diagrams, illustrations, or images that add character. Use judgment on tone — a well-chosen image can do work that words can't.

**Formatting:**
- Resize to content width in the post
- Link the image to its full-size version so readers can click for detail
- Add descriptive alt text

**Image index — when web searching:**

Any image found by web search that is used or considered worth keeping goes into the project's image index at `docs/images/IMAGE-INDEX.md`. This preserves the find for future entries without re-searching.

Each entry:

```markdown
## slug-or-descriptive-title
**Source:** URL
**Description:** What the image shows
**Intent:** What it communicates or why it was found
**Possible uses:** Contexts or topics where it could work
**Used in:** YYYY-MM-DD-NN-entry-slug.md (or "not yet used")
```

Create `docs/images/IMAGE-INDEX.md` on first use with a simple header:
```markdown
# Image Index

Images found for use in blog entries — descriptions, intent, and possible uses.
```

## Headings

Thematic headings are primary. Structural labels are scaffolding.

**Priority order:**
1. Already thematic → keep it. `## The --skills flag that didn't exist` is already good.
2. Bare structural slot → add a thematic description: `## What we tried: Three failed approaches`
3. Never trade thematic for structural. `## The Pivots (There Were Several)` → `## What we tried` is always a loss.

**Smell check before committing:**
- Could any H2 appear unchanged in a completely different post? If yes, it's too generic.
- Did a heading change make it shorter and more generic? If yes, revert.
- Does an H2 container have H3s doing all the work? The H2 needs to carry meaning too.

## Structure

**No preamble.** Never open with "In this post I will..." or "Today we'll explore...".
Jump straight to the topic.

**No trailing summary.** Don't restate what was just said. Don't add "Thanks for reading."
Don't add a "Next:" template footer. Ends when the point is made.

**No template footers.** `**Next:** ...` is scaffolding, not writing. If there's a
forward-looking note, integrate it as a natural sentence. If there's nothing to say
forward, end on the last real point.

**Series posts (Part 1 of N):** each part is written to stand alone. Series navigation
(← Previous / → Next) is added by `publish-blog` at publish time — not at write time.
A previous part may be revised to link forward once the next part is published.

## Pre-Draft Gate

Before generating any prose, answer these questions. Do not draft until complete.

**Voice classification:**
- Is Claude a participant? If yes — for each section, decide in advance: "I", "we", or "Claude [verb]"?
- Which moments are Claude-naming moments (catching something, reporting back, going off-script)?
- Is Claude introduced by name before "we" is first used?

**Style guide check:**
- Has the voice layer (common or personal) been loaded?
- After drafting, verify each "What to Avoid" item before presenting.
- Do not show a draft that fails the style guide — fix first.
